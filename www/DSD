Data Structure Defintion

Using the same process described under Reference Metadata, the Data Structure Definition (DSD) for SDGs could also be translated using computer-assisted technology. The DSD for SDGs is managed by the SDMX-SDG Working Group of the Interagency Expert Group on SDGs. Currently, a project test site is available in Weblate to translate DSD concepts. A collaboration with UNSD and INSEE is exploring the feasibilty of DSD translation into French. This page will be updated as results are shared.
