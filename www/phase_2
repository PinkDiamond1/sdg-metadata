The SDG Metadata Translation pilot produced a series of [detailed papers](https://worldbank.github.io/sdg-metadata/pilot/documentation/) evaluating the use of computer-assisted methods to produce Russian translations. The protocol was intended to enable others to replicate the pilot for their own translation needs. 

During the second phase of the study, the protocol was refined to accommodate finalization of the SDG Metadata Concepts agreed upon by the SDG SDMX Working Group of the Interagency Expert Group on SDGs. The protocol was also refined to improve automatic formatting of files.

The documents below describe the protocol implemented during this second phase of the study. In MONTH, 2021, the protocol was revised further to more efficiently accomodate ongoing updates to metadata files. See [Documentation](/sdg-metadata/documentation) for more information about this third phase of the study.

 *HINT: Adding metadata files for translation? Start with step 1. Translating metadata files? Start wtih step 3. Updating existing translations? See step 4.
        Editing formatting? For English files, see step 1. For translated files, see step 3.*
