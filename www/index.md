The purpose of this project is to translate metadata for Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) indicators into other languages using computer assisted translation tools. A low cost, efficient, and accurate method was needed to improve the transparency and accessibility of metadata for statistical capacity building.

* In January-March 2020, a [pilot](/sdg-metadata/pilot/) was conducted as the result of a collaboration by the World Bank Group under the ECASTAT Trust Fund in coordination with UNECE and ROSSTAT. The pilot produced Russian translations of selected SDG metadata with an estimated reduction of translation time of 35%. 

* In October 2020, the [second phase](/sdg-metadata/documentation) of the study was launched. All SDG indicator metadata files designated by the IAEG-SDGs as tier 1 were converted into machine-readable format and translated. 

* In MONTH 2021, the study will be expanded to include all tier 2 metadata files. In addition, all updated tier 1 metadata files that have been approved by the IAEG-SDG will be available for translation updates. Files will be harvested from the UNSD SDG Data Lab on a routine basis. This expansion is possible due to a new partnership with the UN Food and Agriculture Organization, and ongoing collaboration with the SDMX-SDG Working Group, the IAEG-SDG Metadata Working Group, and the secretariat of the IAEG-SDGs.

Translations are prepared through our ongoing partnerships with national statistical offices and regional agencies. UNECE and Rosstat prepared Russian translations. Statistics Canada prepared French translations. ECLAC and IADB prepared Spanish translations. We welcome partners to generate translations into other languages.

The [SDG Data Structure Defintion] also can be translated into local languages using our computer-assisted method. These structural metadata are used to convey SDG data into the SDG Data Lab. Translatating the DSD can assist national statistical offices preparing and contributing SDG data. A collaboration with INSEE is exploring French translation.
