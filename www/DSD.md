Using a similar process described under Reference Metadata, the Data Structure Definition (DSD) for SDGs could also be translated using computer-assisted technology. This would assist the efficiency and sustainabilty of translations over time. 

The DSD for SDGs is managed by the [SDMX-SDG Working Group](https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/iaeg-sdgs/sdmx-working-group/) of the Interagency Expert Group on SDGs. 
Currently, a pilot [test site](https://hosted.weblate.org/matrix/sdg-dsd/) is available in Weblate. Here, the DSD concepts have been computer-translated into several languages. However, these translations require verification by a human translator. A collaboration with UNSD and INSEE is now exploring the quality of the translation into French. 

This page will be updated as results are shared.
