The SDG Metadata Translation [pilot](/sdg-metadata/pilot/) produced a series of [detailed papers](https://worldbank.github.io/sdg-metadata/pilot/documentation/) evaluating the use of computer-assisted methods to produce Russian translations. The protocol was intended to enable others to replicate the pilot for their own translation needs. 

During the [second phase](/sdg-metadata/phase_2/) of the study, the protocol was refined to accommodate finalization of the SDG Metadata Concepts agreed upon by the SDG SDMX Working Group of the Interagency Expert Group on SDGs. The protocol also was refined to improve automatic formatting of files.

The project has now begun its third phase. The enhanced protocol provides translators with the most recent updates to English metadata files. Leveraging the method developed during the second phase of our project, UNSD now produces machine-readable metadata files and stores them in the SDG Data Lab. Accordingly, our project now 'harvests' these metadata files routinely and places them into our computer-assisted translation tool for translation by our partners. The result is a more efficient, timely, and accurate method of maintaining metadata files as revisions are approved by the IAEG-SDGs.

* The first harvest occurred on DATE. Beginning September 30th, metadata will be harvested on **the last Friday of every quarter.**
    Quarter 1: ends March 31
    Quarter 2: ends June 30
    Quarter 3: ends September 30
    Quarter 4: ends December 31
