The SDG Metadata Translation [pilot](/sdg-metadata/pilot/) produced a series of [detailed papers](https://worldbank.github.io/sdg-metadata/pilot/documentation/) evaluating the use of computer-assisted methods to produce Russian translations. The protocol was intended to enable others to replicate the pilot for their own translation needs. 

During the [second phase](/sdg-metadata/phase_2/) of the study, the protocol was refined to accommodate finalization of the SDG Metadata Concepts agreed upon by the SDG SDMX Working Group of the Interagency Expert Group on SDGs. The protocol was refined to improve automatic formatting of files.

The study has now begun its third phase. The enhanced protocol provides translators with the most recent updates to English metadata files. By leveraging the method developed during the second phase of our study, UNSD now produces machine-readable metadata files and stores them in the SDG Data Lab. Accordingly, our study now 'harvests' these metadata files routinely and places them into our computer-assisted translation tool for translation by our partners. 

* The first harvest was implemented on DATE. Beginning DATE, metadata will be harvested on **the last Friday of every quarter.**
