  <p><strong>Definition:</strong></p>

  <p>The change in water use efficiency over time (CWUE). The change in the
  ratio of the value added to the volume of water use, over time.</p>

  <p>Water Use Efficiency (WUE) is defined as the value added of a given major
  sector<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2" id="footnote-ref-2">[1]</a></sup></sup>
  divided by the volume of water used. Following ISIC 4 coding, sectors are
  defined as:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>agriculture; forestry; fishing (ISIC A), hereinafter &#x201C;agriculture&#x201D;;</li>
    <li>mining and quarrying; manufacturing; electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply; constructions (ISIC B, C, D and F), hereinafter &#x201C;MIMEC&#x201D;;</li>
    <li>all the service sectors (ISIC E and ISIC G-T), hereinafter &#x201C;services&#x201D;.</li>
  </ol>

    <li>Water use: water that is received by an industry or households from another industry or is directly abstracted. [SEEA-Water (ST/ESA/STAT/SER.F/100), par. 2.21]</li>
    <li>Water abstraction: water removed from the environment by the economy. [SEEA-Water (ST/ESA/STAT/SER.F/100), par. 2.9]</li>
    <li>Water use for irrigation (km&#xB3;/year) <ul>
        <li>Annual quantity of water used for irrigation purposes. It includes water from renewable freshwater resources, as well as water from over-abstraction of renewable groundwater or abstraction of fossil groundwater, direct use of agricultural drainage water, (treated) wastewater, and desalinated water. [AQUASTAT Glossary]</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Water use for livestock (watering and cleaning) (km&#xB3;/year) <ul>
        <li>Annual quantity of water used for livestock purposes. It includes water from renewable freshwater resources, as well as water from over-abstraction of renewable groundwater or abstraction of fossil groundwater, direct use of agricultural drainage water, (treated) wastewater, and desalinated water. It includes livestock watering, sanitation, cleaning of stables, etc. If connected to the public water supply network, water used for livestock is included in the services water use. [AQUASTAT Glossary]</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Water use for aquaculture (km&#xB3;/year) <ul>
        <li>Annual quantity of water used for aquaculture. It includes water from renewable freshwater resources, as well as water from over-abstraction of renewable groundwater or abstraction of fossil groundwater, direct use of agricultural drainage water, (treated) wastewater, and desalinated water. Aquaculture is the farming of aquatic organisms in inland and coastal areas, involving intervention in the rearing process to enhance production and the individual or corporate ownership of the stock being cultivated.

      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Water use for the MIMEC sectors (km&#xB3;/year)<ul>
        <li>Annual quantity of water used for the MIMEC sector. It includes water from renewable freshwater resources, as well as over-abstraction of renewable groundwater or abstraction of fossil groundwater and use of desalinated water or direct use of (treated) wastewater. This sector refers to self-supplied industries not connected to the public distribution network. [AQUASTAT Glossary. To be noted that in AQUASTAT, the sectors included in the MIMEC group are referred to as &#x201C;industry&#x201D;]<sup><a href="#footnote-3" id="footnote-ref-3">[2]</a></sup></li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Water use for the services sectors (km&#xB3;/year)<ul>
        <li>Annual quantity of water used primarily for the direct use by the population. It includes water from renewable freshwater resources, as well as over-abstraction of renewable groundwater or abstraction of fossil groundwater and the use of desalinated water or direct use of treated wastewater. It is usually computed as the total water used by the public distribution network. It can include that part of the industries, which is connected to the municipal network. [AQUASTAT Glossary.

      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Value added (gross)<ul>
        <li>Value added is the net output of a sector after adding up all outputs and subtracting intermediate inputs. It is calculated without making deductions for depreciation of fabricated assets or depletion and degradation of natural resources. The industrial origin of value added is determined by the International Standard Industrial Classification (ISIC), revision 4. [WB Databank, metadata glossary, modified]</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Arable land<ul>
        <li>Arable land is the land under temporary agricultural crops (multiple-cropped areas are counted only once), temporary meadows for mowing or pasture, land under market and kitchen gardens and land temporarily fallow (less than five years). The abandoned land resulting from shifting cultivation is not included in this category. Data for &#x201C;Arable land&#x201D; are not meant to indicate the amount of land that is potentially cultivable. [FAOSTAT]</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Permanent crops<ul>
        <li>Permanent crops are the land cultivated with long-term crops which do not have to be replanted for several years (such as cocoa and coffee); land under trees and shrubs producing flowers, such as roses and jasmine; and nurseries (except those for forest trees, which should be classified under &quot;forest&quot;). Permanent meadows and pastures are excluded from land under permanent crops. [FAOSTAT]</li>

    </li>
    <li>Proportion of irrigated land on the total cultivated land<ul>
        <li>Total harvested irrigated crop area, expressed in percentage. Area under double irrigated cropping (same area cultivated and irrigated twice a year) is counted twice</li>

SOURCE_TYPE: >-
  <p>Data needed for the calculation of the indicator are administrative data
  collected at country level by the relevant institutions, either technical (for
  water and irrigation) or economic (for value added). Official counterparts at
  country level are the national statistics offices and/or the line Ministry for
  water resources and irrigation. More specifically, FAO requests countries to
  nominate a National Correspondent to act as the focal point for the data
  collection and communication. Data are mainly published within national
  statistical yearbooks, national water resources and irrigation master plans,
  and other reports (such as those from projects, international surveys or
  results and publications from national and international research
  centres).</p>
COLL_METHOD: >-
  <p>Data collection is done through FAO&apos;s global information system on
  water and agriculture (AQUASTAT) </p>

  <p>and the AQUASTAT questionnaire on water and agriculture. The data
  collection process relies on a network of National Correspondents, officially
  nominated by their respective countries, in charge of the provision of
  official national data to AQUASTAT. As of August 2020, 150 countries have
  nominated national correspondents, as well as alternate correspondents from
  different agencies. Countries submit data through the annual AQUASTAT
  questionnaire on water and agriculture, which contains- among others - the
  information required for the calculation of SDG indicator 6.4.1. Regarding the
  economic indicators (GVA), FAO uses UNSD data base and aggregates it following
  the revision 4 ISIC-4 is used as the standard for the definition of the
  economic sectors.</p>
FREQ_COLL: >-
  <p>Data are collected every year through the AQUASTAT network of National
  Correspondents. FAO has dispatched the questionnaires to the National
  Correspondents between April and July 2020.</p>
REL_CAL_POLICY: >-
  <p>Data are released every year, usually in February following the UNSD
  collection schedule. </p>
DATA_SOURCE: >-
  <p>Data come from governmental sources. Data providers are different depending
  on the country. In many cases data collection at country level is coordinated
  by the National Statistics Office (NSO). Data not generated by a country is
  displayed with an appropriate qualifier. t</p>
COMPILING_ORG: >-
  <p>Calculation rules are predefined and use data referring to the same year to
  generate aggregate values. </p>
INST_MANDATE: >-
  <p>FAO has, as part of its mandate, the function of &#x201C;collect, analyse,
  interpret and disseminate information relating to nutrition, food and
  agriculture&#x201D;. (FAO Constitution, Article 1)</p>
RATIONALE: >-
  <p>The rationale behind this indicator consists in providing information on
  the efficiency of the economic and social usage of water resources, i.e. value
  added generated by the use of water in the main sectors of the economy, and
  distribution network losses.</p>

  <p>The distribution efficiency of water systems is implicit within the
  calculations and could be made explicit if needed and where data are
  available.</p>

  <p>This indicator addresses specifically the target component
  &#x201C;substantially increase water-use efficiency across all
  sectors&#x201D;, by measuring the output per unit of water from productive
  uses of water as well as losses in municipal water use. It does not aim at
  giving an exhaustive picture of the water utilization in a country. Other
  indicators, specifically those for Targets 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, 2.2, 5.4, 5.a, 6.1,
  6.2, 6.3, 6.5 will complement the information provided by this indicator. In
  particular, the indicator needs to be combined with the water stress indicator
  6.4.2 to provide adequate follow-up of the target 6.4.</p>

  <p>Together, the three sectoral efficiencies provide a measure of overall
  water efficiency in a country. The indicator provides incentives to improve
  water use efficiency through all sectors, highlighting those sectors where
  water use efficiency is lagging behind.</p>

  <p>The interpretation of the indicator would be enhanced by the utilization of
  supplementary indicators to be used at country level. Particularly important
  in this sense would be the indicator on efficiency of water for energy and the
  indicator on the efficiency of the municipality distribution networks.</p>
REC_USE_LIM: >-
  <p>The corrective coefficient Cr for the agricultural sector is needed in
  order to focus the indicator on the irrigated production. This is done for two
  main reasons:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>To ensure that only runoff water and groundwater (so-called blue water) are considered in computing the indicator;</li>
    <li>To eliminate a potential bias of the indicators, which otherwise would tend to decrease if rainfed cropland is converted to irrigated.</li>
  </ul>
DATA_COMP: >-
  <p><strong>Computation Method:</strong></p>

  <p>Water use efficiency is computed as the sum of the three sectors listed
  above, weighted according to the proportion of water used by each sector over
  the total use. In formula:</p>

  <p>It must be noted that computing the indicator in an aggregated manner, i.e.
  total GDP over total water use, would lead to an overestimation of the
  indicator. That is due to the fact that, for the agricultural sector, only the
  value produced under irrigation has to be counted in calculating the
  indicator. Hence, the sum of the value added of the various sectors used in
  these formulas is not equivalent to the total GDP of the country.</p>
DATA_VALIDATION: >-
  <p>Data validation is done in a number of steps. </p>

  <ul>
    <li>the AQUASTAT questionnaire embeds automatic validation rules to allow National Correspondents to identify any data consistency errors while compiling the data. </li>
    <li> Once the questionnaire is submitted, FAO thoroughly reviews the information reported, using the following tools:<ul>
        <li>Manual cross-variable check. This includes cross-comparison with similar countries as well as historic data for the countries. </li>
        <li>Time-series coherency by running an R-script to compare reported data with those corresponding to previous years</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>Verification of the metadata, in particular the source of the proposed
  data. The critical analysis of the compiled data gives preference to national
  sources and expert knowledge.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>After this verification, exchanges between the National Correspondents and FAO takes place to correct and confirm the collected data. </li>
    <li>The last validation step is an automated validation routine included in the Statistical Working System (SWS), which uses almost 200 validation rules. </li>
  </ul>
ADJUSTMENT: >-
  <p>Since national level data is frequently tailored to be useful at national
  level and not for international comparisons, data may be manipulated in order
  to maximize international comparability. Adjusted data is displayed with an
  appropriate qualifier. Data is rounded according to a specific methodology <a
  href="http://www.fao.org/aquastat/en/databases/maindatabase/metadata/">http://www.fao.org/aquastat/en/databases/maindatabase/metadata/</a></p>

  <p>Additionally, the Statistical Working System (SWS) has the correspondence
  among different international codes (FAOSTAT, UNSDM49, ISO2, ISO3) for
  geographic areas and is used to convert area codes in the external sources to
  UNSDM49 codes which is the standard used in the SWS.</p>
IMPUTATION: >-
  <p><strong>&#x2022; At country level</strong></p>

  <p>If scattered data (over time) are available, linear interpolation method
  takes place if there are at least two non-missing values in the time series.
  If not, the only possible way to impute it is through the carry-forward.
  Imputed data is displayed with an appropriate qualifier. </p>

  <p><strong>&#x2022; At regional and global levels</strong></p>

  <p>If country data are missing, the value of the indicator will be considered
  in the average of the others in the same region. Imputed data is displayed
  with an appropriate qualifier. </p>
REG_AGG: >-
  <p>The aggregation for global and regional estimations is done by summing up
  the values of the various parameters constituting the elements of the formula,
  i.e. value added by sector and water use by sector. The aggregated indicator
  is then calculated by applying the formula with those aggregated data, as if
  it were a single country.</p>

  <p>An Excel sheet with the calculations exists, and can be shared with the
  IAEG if required.</p>
DOC_METHOD: |-
  <ul>
    <li>A set of tools is available to countries for the compilation of the indicator. Among them, a step-by-step methodological guide, an interpretation paper, and an e-learning course. All the tools are available on the FAO web pages, at: <a href="http://www.fao.org/sustainable-development-goals/indicators/641/en/">http://www.fao.org/sustainable-development-goals/indicators/641/en/</a></li>
    <li>During 2020 and 2021 FAO has organized four virtual trainings for Asia, Latin-America and the Caribbean and Africa on SDG 6.4. </li>
    <li>FAO&#x2019;s AQUASTAT team provides continued guidance to the countries thought the National Correspondents during the data collection time to ensure data is duly and timely compiled.</li>
  </ul>
QUALITY_MGMNT: |-
  <ul>
    <li>The annual AQUASTAT questionnaire, used for collecting information on SDG indicator 6.4.1 has been endorsed by FAO&#x2019;s Office of the Chief Statistician (OCS).</li>
    <li>During the SDG reporting process, the OCS provides overall guidance, including metadata reporting, based on the Metadata Dissemination Standard approved by the FAO IDWG-Statistics Technical Task Force.</li>
    <li>After revision and validation, SDG indicators are submitted to the OCS which also ensures the quality of the data and results.</li>
  </ul>
QUALITY_ASSURE: >-
  <p>FAO is responsible for the quality of the internal statistical processes
  used to compile the published datasets. The FAO Statistics Quality Assurance
  Framework (SQAF), available at:
  http://www.fao.org/docrep/019/i3664e/i3664e.pdf, provides the necessary
  principles, guidelines and tools to carry out quality assessments. FAO is
  performing an internal bi-annual survey (FAO Quality Assessment and Planning
  Survey) designed to gather information on all of FAO&#x2019;s statistical
  activities, notably to assess the extent to which quality standards are being
  implemented with a view to increasing compliance with the quality dimensions
  of SQAF, documenting best practices and prepare quality improvement plans,
  where necessary. Domain-specific quality assurance activities are carried out
  systematically (e.g. quality reviews, self-assessments, compliance
  monitoring).</p>
QUALITY_ASSMNT: >-
  <p>Overall evaluation of data quality is based on standard quality criteria
  and follows FAO&#x2019;s SQAF. It also includes:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>A qualitative and quantitative manual cross-variable check after data is received. This consists of the verification that all the numbers are consistent based on the internal validation rules embedded in the questionnaire. Any issues identified are flagged and listed to be followed-up with the countries. </li>
    <li>Time-series coherency check done by running an R-script to compare reported data with those corresponding to previous years. Based on this, a scattered diagram is also made by variable and country to allow for a visual verification of historical data. The critical analysis of the compiled data gives preference to national sources and expert knowledge, unless these greatly diverge from historic data or in the case of drastic changes in methodologies used by countries. </li>
    <li>Verification of the metadata, in particular the source of the proposed data. When data sources are not provided, the questionnaire is added as the data source of a given value. </li>
  </ul>
COVERAGE: >-
  <p><strong>Data availability:</strong></p>

  <p> The data needed for the indicator are collected through AQUASTAT and other
  databases (FAOSTAT, UNSD) for 168 countries worldwide. In the 2020 round, XX
  countries reported data upon which the indicator was calculated. The indicator
  values for the rest of the countries are calculated based on vertical
  imputations using carry-forward option as described in section 4.f.</p>

  <p>Breakdown of the number of countries covered by region is as follows:</p>

  <p><strong>Time series:</strong></p>

  <p>1961-2018 (Discontinuous depending on the country. Data are interpolated to
  create timelines. </p>

  <p><strong>Disaggregation:</strong></p>

  <p>The indicator covers all the economic sectors according to the ISIC
  classification, providing the means for more detailed analysis of the water
  use efficiency for national planning and decision-making. </p>

  <p>Although the subdivision into three major aggregated economic sectors as
  defined in chapter 3 is sufficient for the purpose of compiling the indicator,
  wherever possible it is advisable to further disaggregate the indicator,
  according to the following criteria:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Economically, a more refined subdivision of the economic sector can be done using ISIC Rev.4 by the following groups:<ul>
        <li>Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (ISIC A); </li>
        <li>Mining and Quarrying (ISIC B); </li>
        <li>Manufacturing (ISIC C);</li>
        <li>Electricity, Gas, Steam and Air Conditioning Supply (ISIC D); </li>
        <li>Water Supply, Sewerage, Waste Management and Remediation Activities (ISIC E), by</li>
        <li>Water Collection, Treatment and Supply (ISIC 36) <ul>
            <li>Sewerage (ISIC 37)</li>
            <li>Construction (ISIC F)</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Other industries (sum of remaining industries)</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Geographically, computing the indicator by river basin, watershed or administrative units within a country.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>These levels of disaggregation, or a combination of those, will give
  further insight on the dynamics of water use efficiency, providing information
  for remedial policies and actions.</p>

  <p>Data are vertically interpolated in the presence of missing values to allow
  for a time series analysis.</p>
COMPARABILITY: >-
  <p>Geographical: Regional differences, in particular in relation to irrigated
  agriculture and different climatic conditions (including variability) are to
  be considered in the interpretation of this indicator, especially in countries
  with substantial amounts of available water resources. Also for this reason,
  coupling this indicator with water stress (6.4.2) is important for the
  interpretation of the data.</p>

  <p>Over-time: time series are comparable across time. </p>
