SRC_TYPE_COLL_METHOD: ''
SOURCE_TYPE: >-
  <p>For the majority of countries, nationally representative household surveys
  constitute the data source. For a limited number of countries data from
  surveillance systems is used if sufficient population coverage is documented
  (about 80%). For both data sources, the child&#x2019;s height and weight
  measurements have to be collected following recommended standard measuring
  techniques (WHO 2008). </p>
COLL_METHOD: >-
  <p>UNICEF, WHO and the World Bank group jointly review new data sources to
  update the country level estimates. Each agency uses their existing mechanisms
  for obtaining data.</p>

  <p>For WHO, see published database methodology (de Onis et al. 2004). For
  UNICEF, the cadre of dedicated data and monitoring specialists working at
  national, regional and international levels in 190 countries routinely provide
  technical support for the collection and analysis of data. For the past 20
  years UNICEF has undertaken an annual process to update its global databases,
  called Country Reporting on Indicators for Goals (CRING). This exercise is
  done in close collaboration with UNICEF country offices with the purpose of
  ensuring that UNICEF global databases contain updated and internationally
  comparable data. UNICEF country offices are invited to submit, through an
  online system, nationally representative data for over 100 key indicators on
  the well-being of women and children, including stunting. The country office
  staff work with local counterparts to ensure the most relevant data are
  shared. Updates sent by the country offices are then reviewed by sector
  specialists at UNICEF headquarters to check for consistency and overall data
  quality of the submitted estimates and re-analysis where possible. This review
  is based on a set of objective criteria to ensure that only the most reliable
  information is included in the databases. Once reviewed, feedback is made
  available on whether or not specific data points are accepted, and if not, the
  reasons why. UNICEF uses these data obtained through CRING to feed into the
  joint dataset. The World Bank Group provides estimates availabe through the
  Living Standard Measurement Surveys (LSMS) which ussually requires re-analysis
  of datasets given theat the LSMS reports often do not tabulate the stunting
  data. </p>
FREQ_COLL: >-
  <p>Data sources are currently being updated to feed into the 2017 production
  of global and regional estimates and updated country level dataset to be
  released in May 2017.</p>
REL_CAL_POLICY: >-
  <p>The next planned release fo global/regional estimates as well as the
  updated country dataset is May 2017. Global and regional estimates are
  released annually every May starting in 2017. The country level dataset is
  updated and released more often than the global/regional estimates. Although a
  set schedule has not yet been established, there have been at least two annual
  updates (one coinciding with the annual release of the regional/global
  estimates and at least one other update at another time of the year).</p>
DATA_SOURCE: >-
  <p>Data providers vary and most commonly are ministries of health, national
  offices of statistics or national institutes of nutrition. </p>

INST_MANDATE: >-
  <p>Description of the set of rules or other formal set of instructions
  assigning responsibility as well as the authority to an organisation for the
  collection, processing, and dissemination of statistics for this
  indicator.</p>
OTHER_METHOD: ''
RATIONALE: >-
  <p>Child growth is an internationally accepted outcome reflecting child
  nutritional status. Child stunting refers to a child who is too short for his
  or her age and is the result of chronic or recurrent malnutrition. Stunting is
  a contributing risk factor to child mortality and is also a marker of
  inequalities in human development. Stunted children fail to reach their
  physical and cognitive potential. Child stunting is one of the World Health
  Assembly nutrition target indicators.</p>
REC_USE_LIM: >-
  <p>Survey estimates come with levels of uncertainty due to both sampling error
  and non-sampling error (e.g. measurement technical error, recording error
  etc.,). None of the two sources of errors have been fully taken into account
  for deriving estimates neither at country nor at regional and global
  levels.</p>
DATA_COMP: >-
  <p>Survey estimates are based on standardized methodology using the WHO Child
  Growth Standards as described elsewhere (Ref: Anthro software manual). Global
  and regional estimates are based on methodology outlined in UNICEF-WHO-The
  World Bank: Joint child malnutrition estimates - Levels and trends
  (UNICEF/WHO/WB 2012 )</p>
DATA_VALIDATION: >-
  <p>Description of process of monitoring the results of data compilation and
  ensuring the quality of the statistical results, including consultation
  process with countries on the national data submitted to the SDGs Indicators
  Database. Descriptions and links to all relevant reference materials should be
  provided.</p>
ADJUSTMENT: >-
  <p>Description of any adjustments with respect to use of standard
  classifications and harmonization of breakdowns for age group and other
  dimensions, or adjustments made for compliance with specific international or
  national definitions.</p>
IMPUTATION: >-
  <ul>
    <li>At country level</li>
  </ul>

  <p>No imputation methodology is applied to derive estimates for countries or
  years where no data is avaialble.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>At regional and global levels</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Countries and years are treated as missing randomly following a multilevel
  modeling approach (International Journal of Epidemiology 2004;33:1260-70).</p>

  MDG, UNICEF, WHO, The World Bank regions and income groups.</p>

  national level and the relevant international recommendations and guidelines
  available to countries. Descriptions and links to all relevant reference
  materials should be provided. </p>
QUALITY_MGMNT: >-
  <p>Description of systems and frameworks in place within an organisation to
  manage the quality of statistical products and processes.</p>
QUALITY_ASSURE: >-

  dealing with quality of statistical programmes at your agency, including
  measures for ensuring the efficient use of resources.</p>

COVERAGE: >-
  <p><strong>Data availability:</strong></p>

  <p>More than 150 countries.</p>

  <p><strong>Time series:</strong></p>

  <p>At country level, data are provided for the years where surveys are
  included in the joint dataset. Survey years range from 1983 to 2016. For the
  global and regional levels, estimates for the years 1990 to the latest
  available estimate upon release each year (i.e. in Sept 2016 edition of the
  Joint Malnutrition Estimates the latest available estimate was for 2015). </p>

  <p><strong>Disaggregation:</strong></p>

  <p>Global and regional estimates refer to the age group of children under 5
  years, sexes combined. Disaggregated country data are available in a majority
  of household surveys and UNICEF - WHO- The World Bank Group are expanding the
  joint data set to include sub national and stratified estimates (e.g. sex, age
  groups, wealth, mothers&apos; education, residence) in 2017.</p>
COMPARABILITY: >-
  <p><strong>Sources of discrepancies:</strong></p>

  <p>The standard analysis approach to construct the joint data set aims for a
  maximum comparability of country estimates. For the inclusion of survey
  estimates into the JME dataset, the inter-agency group applies survey quality
  assessment criteria. When there is insufficient documentation, the survey is
  not included until information becomes available. When raw data are available,
  and there is a question about the analysis approach, data re-analysis is
  performed following the standard methodology. Discrepancies between results
  from standardised approach and those reported may occur for various reasons,
  for example, the use of different standards for z-score calculations,
  imputation of the day of birth when missing, the use of rounded age in months,
  the use of different flagging systems for data exclusion. For surveys based on
  the previous NCHS/WHO references, and for which raw data are not available, a
  method for converting the z-scores to be based on the WHO Child Growth
  Standards is applied (Yang and de Onis, 2008). In addition, when surveys do
  not cover the age interval 0-&lt;5 years, or are only representative of the
  rural areas, an adjustment based on other surveys for the same country, is
  performed. Any adjustment or conversion is transparently stated in the
  annotated joint data set.</p>
