  <p><strong>Definition:</strong></p>

  <p>The Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030 was adopted by
  UN Member States in March 2015 as a global policy of disaster risk reduction.
  One of the targets is: &#x201C;Substantially increase the number of countries
  with national and local disaster risk reduction strategies by
  2020&#x201D;.</p>

  <p>In line with the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030,
  disaster risk reduction strategies and policies should mainstream and
  integrate disaster risk reduction within and across all sectors, across
  different timescales and with targets, indicators and time frames. These
  strategies should be aimed at preventing the creation of disaster risk, the
  reduction of existing risk and the strengthening of economic, social, health
  and environmental resilience.</p>

  <p>The open-ended intergovernmental expert working group on indicators and
  terminology relating to disaster risk reduction (OIEWG) established by the
  General Assembly (resolution 69/284) has developed a set of indicators to
  measure global progress in the implementation of the Sendai Framework, which
  was endorsed by the UNGA (OIEWG <a
  href="http://www.preventionweb.net/publications/view/51748">report
  A/71/644</a>). The relevant SDG indicators reflect the Sendai Framework
  indicators.</p>

  <p><strong>Concepts:</strong></p>
SOURCE_TYPE: '<p>Sendai Framework Monitor, reported to UNISDR</p>'
COLL_METHOD: >-
  <p>The national Sendai Framework Focal Points will compile all inputs from
  their line ministries, NSO, and other entities, if appropriate, and report
  through the Sendai Framework Monitoring System.</p>

  <p> </p>
FREQ_COLL: '<p>2015 &#x2013;</p>'
REL_CAL_POLICY: <p>Every year from Q2 2018</p>
DATA_SOURCE: >-
  <p>National Sendai Framework Focal Points usually represent the coordinating
  lead institution chairing the National DRR platform which is comprised of
  special purpose agencies including national disaster agencies, civil
  protection agencies, and meteorological agencies.</p>
COMPILING_ORG: <p>UNISDR</p>
RATIONALE: >-
  <p>Increasing the proportion of local governments that adopt and implement
  local disaster risk reduction strategies, which the Sendai Framework calls
  for, will contribute to sustainable development and strengthen economic,
  social, health and environmental resilience. Their economic, environmental and
  social perspectives would include poverty eradication, urban resilience, and
  climate change adaptation.</p>
REC_USE_LIM: >-
  <p>The Hyogo Framework for Action Monitor (HFA Monitor) started in 2007 and
  over time, the number of countries reporting to UNISDR increased from 60 in
  2007 to approximately 100 countries in 2015 undertaking voluntary
  self-assessment of progress in implementing the HFA. During the four reporting
  cycles the HFA Monitor has generated the world&#x2019;s largest repository of
  information on national disaster risk reduction policy inter alia. In 2018 the
  Sendai Framework Monitor system will launch and all Member States are expected
  to report data of the previous year(s).</p>
DATA_COMP: >-
  <p>Member States count the number of local governments that adopt and
  implement local DRR strategies in line with the national strategy and express
  it as a percentage of the total number of local governments in the
  country.</p>

  <p>Local governments are determined by the reporting country for this
  indicator, considering sub-national public administrations with responsibility
  to develop local disaster risk reduction strategies. It is recommended that
  countries report on progress made by the lowest level of government accorded
  the mandate for disaster risk reduction, as the Sendai Framework promotes the
  adoption and implementation of local disaster risk reduction strategies in
  every local authority.</p>

  <p>Each Member State will calculate the ratio of the number of local
  governments with local DRR strategies in line with national strategies and the
  total number of local governments.</p>

  <p>Global Average will then be calculated as below through arithmetic average
  of the data from each Member State.</p>

  <p> Further information of the methodology can be obtained in the Technical
  Guidance (see reference).</p>
IMPUTATION: >-
  <p><strong>&#x2022; At country level</strong></p>

  <p>If a country does not report (missing Value), it will be considered to be 0
  or null as same as the HFA Monitor.</p>

  <p>UNISDR conducted the Sendai Framework Data Readiness Review which 87 Member
  States responded between February and April in 2017. </p>

  <p>In Q1 2018 all Member States will be invited to start reporting. Since in
  the previous monitoring approximately 100 countries reported their National
  HFA Monitor in each cycle, we expect the similar number of reporting.</p>
