  <p>Domestic Material Consumption (DMC) is a standard material flow accounting
  (MFA) indicator and reports the apparent consumption of materials in a
  national economy. </p>

  <p>DMC measures the total amount of material (biomass, fossil fuels, metal
  ores and non-metallic minerals) directly used in an economy and based on
  accounts of direct material flows, i.e., domestic material extraction and
  physical imports and exports.</p>

  <p><strong>Concepts:</strong></p>

  <p>DMC and Material Footprint (MF) need to be looked at in combination, as
  they cover the two aspects of the economy, production and consumption. The DMC
  reports the actual amount of material in an economy, MF the virtual amount
  required across the whole supply chain to service final demand. A country can,
  for instance, have a very high DMC because it has a large primary production
  sector for export or a very low DMC because it has outsourced most of the
  material intensive industrial process to other countries. The material
  footprint corrects for both phenomena. </p>

  <p>The global estimation of DMC is based on data available from different

  <p>For global estimation, the International Resource Panel (IRP) Global

  <p>At the same time, country-provided indicators are collected through the

RATIONALE: >-
  <p>Domestic Material Consumption (DMC) reports the amount of materials that
  are used in a national economy. It is a territorial (production side)
  indicator. DMC also presents the amount of material that needs to be handled
  within an economy, which is either added to material stocks of buildings and
  transport infrastructure or used to fuel the economy as material throughput.
  It describes the physical dimension of economic processes and interactions. It
  can also be interpreted as long-term waste equivalent. Per-capita DMC
  describes the average level of material use in an economy &#x2013; an
  environmental pressure indicator &#x2013; and is also referred to as metabolic
  profile. </p>
REC_USE_LIM: >-
  <p>Domestic Material Consumption cannot be disaggregated to economic sectors
  which limits its potential to become a satellite account to the System of
  National Accounts (SNA). </p>

  (MFA) indicator. MFAs below to environmental-economic accounts and apply the
  accounting concepts, structures, rules and principles of the System of

  in conjunction with reading the global EW-MFA guide The use of natural

DATA_VALIDATION: >-
  <p>United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) sends a prefilled questionnaire
  with estimated data to the National Statistical Office (NSO) Focal Points (FP)
  with a request to validate globally estimated data for this indicator and
  replace the data if needed/possible. The FPs coordinate data validation with
  stakeholders within their countries and report back the data to UNEP. For
  countries with no national data collected for this indicator, UNEP asks to
  agree on publishing and releasing the estimated data on UNEP&#x2019;s World
  Environment Situation Room and UNSD SDG Global database.</p>
ADJUSTMENT: >-
  <p>UNEP replaces globally estimated data by national data if requested by the
  country.</p>
IMPUTATION: >-
  <p><strong>&#x2022;</strong> <strong>At country level:</strong></p>

  <p>A zero is imputed when no positive real value was officially recorded, in
  the base data sets used, for any of the underlying components which make up
  this aggregated total. Thus &#x201C;0.0&#x201D; can represent either NA, or a
  genuine 0.0, or (crucially) a combination of both, which is a common
  situation. This allows for values to be easily aggregated further; however, it
  should be thus noted that due to imputing missing values as
  &#x201C;0.0&#x201D;, the aggregations may represent a lower value than the
  actual situation. </p>

  <p><strong>&#x2022;</strong> <strong>At regional and global
  levels:</strong></p>

  <p>Similarly, missing values are imputed as zero in the regional and global
  aggregations. However, in the case where no data is available at all for a
  particular country, the per capita and per GDP estimates are weighted averages
  of the available data. </p>
REG_AGG: >-
  <p>The data are aggregated at the sub-regional, regional and global levels.

  <p>United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), jointly with the International
  Resource Panel (IRP) and United Nations Statistics Division (UNSD), the
  Statistical Office of the European Union (Eurostat) and the Organisation for

  Economy-Wide Material Flow Accounting (EW-MFA) which brings in the European
  guidelines, but provides a modular approach for countries looking to develop
  EW-MFA for the first time and it addresses specific issues related to resource
  extractive based economies. </p>

  <p>The data covers 193 countries (either globally estimated or country

  <p>Domestic Material Consumption is calculated coherent with international
