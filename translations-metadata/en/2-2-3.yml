  <p>Goal 2: End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and
  promote sustainable agriculture</p>
SDG_TARGET: >-
  <p>Target 2.2: By 2030, end all forms of malnutrition, including achieving, by
  2025, the internationally agreed targets on stunting and wasting in children
  under 5 years of age, and address the nutritional needs of adolescent girls,
  pregnant and lactating women and older persons</p>

META_LAST_UPDATE: <p>March 2021</p>
SDG_RELATED_INDICATORS: >-
  <p>Goal 1. No poverty</p>

  <p>The capacity for physical work is hampered when people are anaemic. Anaemia
  is estimated to contribute to 17% lower productivity in heavy manual labour
  and 5% lower productivity in other manual labour. A modelling exercise in
  India estimated that a birth cohort of individuals with iron-deficiency
  anaemia (IDA) in 2013 will lose more than US$ 24 million over their lifetimes
  as a result of productivity loss due to IDA.</p>

  <p>Additionally, the mental capacity that is undeveloped when children are
  iron deficient affects their academic performance and future earnings
  potential. Consequently, childhood anaemia is associated with a 2.5% drop in
  wages in adulthood, affecting both productivity and economic growth.</p>

  <p>Nutrient deficiencies that can contribute to anaemia include iron,
  riboflavin, folic acid, zinc, vitamin B12, and vitamin A. Currently, more than
  80 countries have legislation to add one or more of these nutrients to wheat
  flour, maize flour, and/or rice. Adding these nutrients to commonly consumed
  grains is one step toward improving productivity and thereby reducing
  poverty.</p>

  <p>Goal 3. Good health and well-being</p>

  <p>Maternal and Newborn Health</p>

  <p>Anaemia during pregnancy increases the risk of maternal and perinatal
  mortality. Anaemia during pregnancy also contributes to low birth-weight
  infants, which the World Health Organization (WHO) defines as weighing less
  than less than 2500 grams or 5.5 pounds. Newborns that are born small are
  prone to death and diseases while they are young. If they survive, they are at
  an increased risk for poor mental development in childhood and chronic health
  problems such as diabetes and heart disease later in life.</p>

  <p>Non-Communicable Diseases</p>

  <p>Anaemia is a non-communicable disease. As noted above, nutritional anaemia
  is caused by vitamin and mineral deficiencies.</p>

  <p>Goal 4. Quality education</p>

  <p>Poor health in childhood can lead to reductions in educational achievement.
  While iron deficiency limits cognitive development, children who have adequate
  iron have more energy to participate in classroom exercises, and they are more
  mentally prepared to master the material.</p>

  <p>A large body of literature documents the positive impact of iron
  interventions on tests of cognitive and motor development. This review found,
  &#x201C;the available evidence satisfies all of the conditions needed to
  conclude that iron deficiency causes cognitive deficits and developmental
  delays and that these can be at least partially reversed by iron therapy,
  though the effect may diminish among older children.&#x201D;</p>

  <p>Goal 5. Gender equality</p>

  <p>Anaemia rates in females are much higher than males. While anaemia rates
  decrease for males by the end of puberty, they remain high for females through
  reproductive years due to menstruation.</p>

  <p>Therefore, reducing anaemia contributes to boosting females&#x2019;
  relative academic performance and worker productivity and helps achieve gender
  equality.</p>

  accessed [4 March 2021).</p>
SRC_TYPE_COLL_METHOD: ''
SOURCE_TYPE: >-
  <p>The preferable source of data is population-based surveys. Data from
  surveillance systems may be used under some conditions, but recorded diagnoses
  are typically underestimated. Data are from the Micronutrients Database of the
  WHO Vitamin and Mineral Information System (VMNIS) (<a
  href="https://www.who.int/vmnis/database/en/">https://www.who.int/vmnis/database/en/</a>).
  This database compiles and summarizes data on the micronutrient status of
  populations from various other sources, including data collected from the
  scientific literature and through collaborators, including WHO regional and
  country offices, United Nations organizations, ministries of health, research
  and academic institutions, and nongovernmental organizations. In addition,
  anonymized individual-level data are obtained from multi-country surveys,
  including demographic and health surveys, multiple indicator cluster surveys,
  reproductive health surveys and malaria indicator surveys.</p>
COLL_METHOD: >-
  <p>The anaemia status of women is assessed using blood haemoglobin
  concentrations. In surveys, blood haemoglobin concentrations are typically
  measured using the direct cyanmethemoglobin method in a laboratory or with a
  portable, battery-operated, haemoglobin photometer in the field that uses the
  azide-methaemoglobin method.</p>

  <p>A PubMed search was carried out for relevant search terms related to
  anaemia, haemoglobin and iron status, searching for studies published after 1
  January 1990. In addition to indexed articles, many reports of national and
  international agencies were identified and accessed through requests to each
  corresponding organization. Data are also collected during the country
  validation process, described below, and from publicly available
  individual-level survey data. </p>
FREQ_COLL: >-
  <p>Data on anaemia are continuously being collected from survey report and
  manuscripts and entered into the WHO Micronutrients Database.</p>
REL_CAL_POLICY: >-
  <p>There is no fixed date in which the new round of anaemia estimates will be
  generated; however, estimates are generally generated every three to five
  years.</p>
DATA_SOURCE: >-
  <p>There are two main data sources of survey data for anaemia: 1) reports
  generated by countries or implementing partners and 2) published manuscripts.
  Occasionally, Member States, regional offices, the international community or
  colleagues managing other databases within WHO provide reports directly to
  staff responsible for maintaining the WHO Micronutrients Database. If data
  meet the eligibility criteria, they are entered into the database. Reports and
  publications are primarily requested and collected from: </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Ministries of Health through WHO regional and country offices, </li>
    <li>National research and academic institutions,</li>
    <li>Nongovernmental organizations, and</li>
    <li>Organizations of the <a href="http://www.unsceb.org/directory">United Nations</a> system. </li>
  </ul>
COMPILING_ORG: >-
  <p>WHO compiles the data fed into the Micronutrients Database of the WHO
  Vitamin and Mineral Information System (VMNIS).</p>
INST_MANDATE: >-
  <p>The Vitamin and Mineral Nutrition Information System (VMNIS), formerly
  known as the Micronutrient Deficiency Information System (MDIS), was
  established in 1991 following a request by the World Health Assembly to
  strengthen surveillance of micronutrient deficiencies at the global level.
  Part of WHO&apos;s mandate is to assess the micronutrient status of
  populations, monitor and evaluate the impact of strategies for the prevention
  and control of micronutrient malnutrition, and to track related trends over
  time.</p>
OTHER_METHOD: ''
RATIONALE: >-
  <p>Anaemia is highly prevalent globally, disproportionately affecting children
  and women of reproductive age. It negatively affects cognitive and motor
  development and work capacity, and among pregnant women iron deficiency
  anaemia is associated with adverse reproductive outcomes, including preterm
  delivery, low-birth-weight infants, and decreased iron stores for the baby,
  which may lead to impaired development. Iron deficiency is considered the most
  common cause of anaemia, but there are other nutritional and non-nutritional
  causes. Blood haemoglobin concentrations are affected by many factors,
  including altitude (metres above sea level), smoking, trimester of pregnancy,
  age and sex. Anaemia can be assessed by measuring blood haemoglobin, and when
  used in combination with other indicators of iron status, blood haemoglobin
  provides information about the severity of iron deficiency. The anaemia
  prevalence for the population is used to classify the public health
  significance of the problem.</p>
REC_USE_LIM: >-
  <p>Despite the extensive data search, data for blood haemoglobin
  concentrations are still limited, compared to other nutritional indicators
  such as child anthropometry (1, 24); this was especially true in the
  high-income countries of the WHO European Region. As a result, the estimates
  may not capture the full variation across countries and regions, tending to
  &#x201C;shrink&#x201D; towards global means when data are sparse. </p>

  <p>Estimates may differ from those reported by countries.</p>
DATA_COMP: >-
  <p>Prevalence of anaemia and/or mean haemoglobin in women of reproductive age
  were obtained from 408 population-representative data sources from 124
  countries worldwide. Data collected from 1995 to 2020 were used. Adjustment of
  data on blood haemoglobin concentrations for altitude and smoking was carried
  out whenever possible. Biologically implausible haemoglobin values (&lt;25 g/L
  or &gt;200 g/L) were excluded. A Bayesian hierarchical mixture model was used
  to estimate haemoglobin distributions and systematically addressed missing
  data, non-linear time trends, and representativeness of data sources. Full
  details on statistical methods may be found <a
  href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4547326/">here</a>: Global,
  regional, and national trends in haemoglobin concentration and prevalence of
  total and severe anaemia in children and pregnant and non-pregnant women for
  1995&#x2013;2011: a systematic analysis of population-representative data
  (Stevens et al, 2013). Briefly, the model calculates estimates for each
  country and year, informed by data from that country and year themselves, if
  available, and by data from other years in the same country and in other
  countries with data for similar time periods, especially countries in the same
  region. The model borrows data, to a greater extent, when data are
  non-existent or weakly informative, and to a lesser degree for data-rich
  countries and regions. The resulting estimates are also informed by covariates
  that help predict blood haemoglobin concentrations (e.g. socio-demographic
  index, meat supply (kcal/capita), mean BMI for women and log of under-five
  mortality for children). The uncertainty ranges (credibility intervals)
  reflect the major sources of uncertainty, including sampling error,
  non-sampling error due to issues in sample design/measurement, and uncertainty
  from making estimates for countries and years without data.</p>
DATA_VALIDATION: >-
  <p>Once survey data are compiled and the Bayesian hierarchical mixture model
  is run to generate anaemia estimates, countries are sent a memorandum to
  provide a background to the estimates and explain the process. Information on
  the survey data used to generate the estimates for that country, estimates for
  the years 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015, and 2019, and the resulting plots for each
  country are provided along with an explanation of the methodology used in
  generating the estimates. Countries are requested to provide feedback within
  six weeks.</p>
ADJUSTMENT: >-
  <p>Data on mean haemoglobin and anaemia prevalence from high-altitude
  countries that were not adjusted for altitude when published were adjusted for
  altitude by WHO, as described in Stevens et al (2013). The Bayesian
  hierarchical mixture internally adjusts summary statistics computed with
  non-standard haemoglobin cutoffs to match the standard WHO cutoffs listed
  above. </p>

QUALITY_ASSURE: >-
  <p>Survey data provided in peer-reviewed publications or survey reports are
  screened for inclusion in the WHO Micronutrients Database. Eligibility
  criteria to the Micronutrients database include: details of the sampling
  method are provided; the sample was representative of at least the 1st
  administrative level (e.g. state, province, canton, oblast); the sample was
  population-based, household-based, or facility-based (i.e., for pregnant
  women, newborns, and preschool and school-age children); the sample was
  cross-sectional or was the baseline assessment in an intervention programme;
  and the study used standard, validated data collection techniques and
  laboratory methodology. If there are particular concerns regarding the
  reported data, attempts are made to discuss these concerns with a country
  representative.</p>
QUALITY_ASSMNT: >-
  <p>Data from the Micronutrients database passes an additional screening to be
  included into the estimates if a facility-based sampling scheme was used in
  order to exclude data where these would not be representative of the general
  population. The general threshold for inclusion was 80% affiliation of the
  target population with the facility. For studies of children sampled from
  primary care physician rosters or well-child visits, we included the data if
  national coverage of the third dose of DTP vaccine exceeded 80%. For women
  sampled from obstetric care providers, data were included if the coverage of
  at least one ANC care was greater than 80%. For school-based sampling of
  adolescents, the completion rate of lower secondary school for girls was
  required to be greater than 80%.</p>

  <p>We excluded data if migrants comprised more than 40% of the population in
  the country, and the data source only covered nationals. Quality checks (e.g.
  implausible values that are not in according with life, ) are done when data
  is entered into the database, and when data is compiled for producing the
  estimates.</p>
COVERAGE: >-
  <p><strong>Data availability:</strong></p>

  <p>Prevalence of anaemia and/or mean haemoglobin in women of reproductive age
  were obtained from 408 population-representative data sources from 124
  countries worldwide. Data collected from 1995 to 2020 were used.</p>

  <p> </p>

  <p><strong>Time series:</strong></p>

  <p>Estimates for 2000 to 2019 were derived in the latest exercise.</p>

  <p><strong>Disaggregation:</strong></p>

  <p>Anaemia prevalence data are generally reported disaggregated by age, sex,
  income, geographic region (within country) and 1<sup>st</sup> administrative
  level within a country. When producing estimates of anaemia for the purpose of
  contributing to the monitoring of SDGs, estimates are produced for women of
  reproductive age (15-49 years) by pregnancy status (pregnant or
  non-nonpregnant) for each country. Data are then aggregated by WHO or UN
  region and for the global level.</p>
