  <h2>Definition:</h2>

  <p>Indicator based on WBG data:<em> &#x201C;Amount of United States dollars
  committed to public-private partnerships in infrastructure</em>.&#x201D;</p>

  <p>The indicator by the World Bank Group defines the term Public-Private
  Partnership (PPPs) as &#x201C;<em>any contractual arrangement between a public
  entity or authority and a private entity, for providing a public asset or
  service, in which the private party bears significant risk and management
  responsibility</em>.&#x201D;<strong> </strong></p>

  <p>The term infrastructure refers to:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Energy: electricity generation, transmission, and distribution, and natural gas transmission and distribution pipelines</li>
    <li>Information and communications technology (ICT): ICT backbone infrastructure</li>
    <li>Transport: Airports, railways, ports, and roads.</li>
    <li>Water: potable water treatment and distribution, and sewerage collection and treatment.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The indicator has a established methodology that is available at the
  website <a
  href="http://ppi.worldbank.org/methodology/ppi-methodology">http://ppi.worldbank.org/methodology/ppi-methodology</a>
  and the data collection process is as follows:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Team of researcher gather data for each of the regions using public sources; commercial news databases as well as from commercial specialized and industry publications/subscriptions, specialist portal, sponsor information and multilateral development agencies.</li>
    <li>Data is uploaded to an administrative website through a template to make sure data is standardized.</li>
    <li>Data is validated by a group of experts in Singapore first (PPI team), then for the World Bank Group focal points colleagues.</li>
    <li>Data is later uploaded to the public website (www.ppi.worldbank.org) and make it available free of charge.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The dataset is known as the Private Participation in Infrastructure (PPI)
  database. Updates are provided every six months (usually April and October)
  and the data is publicly available at <a
  href="http://www.ppi.worldbank.org">www.ppi.worldbank.org</a>. This indicator
  is also available at the World Development Indicators at
  http://databank.worldbank.org/data/reports.aspx?source=world-development-indicators</p>
COLL_METHOD: >-
  <p>A Team of researcher gather data for each of the regions using public
  sources (from government and MDBs websites); commercial news databases ( such
  as Factiva, Business News America, ISI Emerging markets, and the Economist
  Intelligence Unit&#x2019;s databases) as well as from commercial specialized
  and industry publications/subscriptions (Thomson Financial&#x2019;s Project
  Finance International, Euromoney&#x2019;s Project Finance, Media
  Analytics&#x2019; Global Water Intelligence, Pisent Masons&#x2019; Water
  Yearbooks, and Platt&#x2019;s Power in Asia, etc.), specialist portal (such as
  Privatization, IPAnet, and Privatization Barometer), Internet resources (such
  as web sites of project companies, privatization or PPP agencies, and
  regulatory agencies) sponsor information (primarily through their Web sites,
  annual reports, press releases, and financial reports such as 10K and 20F
  forms submitted to the NYSE) and multilateral development agencies primarily
  through information on their Websites, annual reports, and other studies.</p>

  <p>Data is uploaded to an administrative website through a template to make
  sure data is standardized.</p>

  <p>Data is validated by a group of experts in Singapore first (PPI team), then
  for the World Bank Group focal points colleagues.</p>

  <p>Data is later uploaded to the public website (www.ppi.worldbank.org) and
  make it available free of charge. The website has a mechanism for challenges
  the data and welcome all PPP units to challenges the information about any
  project.</p>
FREQ_COLL: >-
  <p>Data is collected in an ongoing basis. Updates are provided every six
  months (usually April and October).</p>
REL_CAL_POLICY: >-
  <p>Data for the first half of the calendar year is released in October and for
  the full year is usually released around April.</p>
DATA_SOURCE: >-
  <p>While the data is currently collected by the World Bank Group, PPP units at
  national and subnational level are identified as national data providers that
  could directly provide data on projects financially closed each year or they
  could actively validate data collected by World Bank group.</p>
COMPILING_ORG: <p>The World Bank Group</p>
RATIONALE: >-
  <p>The infrastructure gaps is significant and it would require to increase
  private sector financing. The rationale behind the indicator is to measure the
  changes in the volume of public private partnerships in infrastructure and
  assess trends and identify constraints for private sector participation.</p>
REC_USE_LIM: >-
  <p>The limitations of the proposed indicator is that it does not account for
  other sectors such as education and health may account for a significant part
  of PPPs but they are not captured by the database. </p>

  <p>The database only covers low and middle income countries (World Bank
  classification) and it does not collect the indicator for high income
  countries. Expanding the data to include high income countries as well as PPPs
  in other sector beyond infrastructure is something that the World Bank is
  considering but it is currently limited by budget constraints.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, PPI database does not collect data on civil society
  partnerships and this will not fit the currently methodology of data gathering
  and is outside the present work&#x2019;s scope.</p>

IMPUTATION: >-
  <p><strong>&#x2022; At country level</strong></p>

  <p>Data is collected semi-annually for all emerging markets and development
  economies. When there are no PPP projects in a country, the data shows a value
  of zero investments. If there is information of a project in a country but the
  information on investments is not available, then it is reported as missing
  value. No imputations are performed for missing values.</p>

  <p><strong>&#x2022; At regional and global levels</strong></p>

  <p>No imputations are carried out for missing values in the database. </p>
REG_AGG: >-
  <p>Regional and global aggregates are calculated by adding investment values
  of all countries in that region or globally without any weight assigned. The
  only adjustment that the data does is to account only once cross border
  projects, i.e. projects that involve more than one country and therefore have
  a unique project investment value. Cross border projects are counted for each
  country when data is presented at country level but only once when data is
  aggregated at regional or global level.</p>
DOC_METHOD: >-
  <p>&#x2022; Currently countries do not compile this indicator. However,
  methodology for the PPI database can be used by any country to provide
  information on the PPP projects that reached financial closure a particular
  year, or they could validate the list of projects provided by the PPI
  database.</p>
QUALITY_ASSURE: |-
  <ul>
    <li>The semi-annual list of projects goes through an extensive quality control process first by the PPI database team, then by the Infrastructure, PPPs and Guarantees group at the World Bank and finally it is shared for comment to all World Bank Group including focal points in IFC and MIGA. In addition, when data is released public ally, any project can be challenged in the website and therefore data will be reassessed and corrected if necessary.</li>
    <li>No consultation project with countries on the national data is ongoing but the PPI database welcomes feedback and data contributors in the website.</li>
  </ul>
COVERAGE: >-
  <p><strong>Data availability:</strong></p>

  <p>The existing PPI database includes data on 6,400 projects over 28 years
  (1990-2019), with over 50 variables per project. It covers projects in 139 low
  and middle income countries as classified by the World Bank. The list of
  countries is reviewed every five years in order to maintain continuity in the
  data. </p>

  <p><strong>Time series:</strong></p>

  <p>The indicator is available since 1990 and data can be disaggregated on the
  monthly basis (i.e total investments in infrastructure PPP projects that
  reached financial closure in a particular month since 1990).</p>

  <p><strong>Disaggregation:</strong></p>

  <p>The unit of analysis is the PPP project; therefore, data can be
  disaggregated at the project level. There is data on sector and subsector as
  well as geographical location of the project at the subnational level and
  therefore it can be later aggregated by municipality, province, country or
  region.</p>
COMPARABILITY: >-
  <p><strong>Sources of discrepancies:</strong></p>

  <p>To our knowledge, countries do not produce estimates of this indicator.
  Some PPP units in very few countries have data available in their website but
  it is neither presented in a cross- country comparable approach nor annually
  reported.</p>
