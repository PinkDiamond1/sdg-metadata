  <h1>Concepts and definitions</h1>

  <h2>Definition:</h2>

  <p>In order to measure fossil fuel subsidies at the national, regional and
  global level, three sub-indicators are recommended for reporting on this
  indicator: 1) direct transfer of government funds; 2) induced transfers (price
  support); and as an optional sub-indicator 3) tax expenditure, other revenue
  foregone, and under-pricing of goods and services. The definitions of the IEA
  Statistical Manual (IEA, 2005) and the Agreement on Subsidies and
  Countervailing Measures (ASCM) under the World Trade Organization (WTO) (WTO,
  1994) are used to define fossil fuel subsidies. Standardised descriptions from
  the United Nations Statistical Office&#x2019;s Central Product Classification
  should be used to classify individual energy products. It is proposed to drop
  the wording &#x201C;as a proportion of total national expenditure on fossil
  fuels&#x201D; and thus this indicator is effectively &quot;Amount of fossil
  fuel subsidies per unit of GDP (production and consumption)&quot;.</p>

  <h2>Concepts:</h2>

  <p>The concepts and definitions used in the methodology have been based on
  existing international frameworks and glossaries.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Use definition of fossil fuels from IEA Statistics Manual, &#x201C;Fossil fuels are taken from natural resources which were formed from biomass in the geological past. By extension, the term fossil is also applied to any secondary fuel manufactured from a fossil fuel.&#x201D;</li>
    <li>Use the terms set out in CPC Rev. 2.1 for the statistical classification of the individual products. No other commonly accepted definition identified</li>
    <li>Include electricity and heat generated from fossil fuels in the scope of fossil fuels. </li>
    <li>Include non-energy uses with monitoring optional for the measuring of this indicator.</li>
    <li>Additional details are provided in the methodological document entitled, Measuring Fossil Fuel Subsidies in the Context of the Sustainable Development Goals.</li>

  <h1>Data sources</h1>

  <h2>Description:</h2>

  <p>Direct transfers are generally reported in government budgets, and well
  documented in sectoral and Finance Ministries, broken down by programme if not
  by fuel. Those that meet the SNA definition of &#x201C;subsidies&#x201D;
  &#x2013; i.e., subsidies on products, and other subsidies on production
  &#x2013; can also be found in a country&#x2019;s System of National Accounts.
  Budget documents are publicly available for most countries. The degree to
  which information on individual programmes is itemized in those reports is
  highly variable, however. Support to corporations involved in energy
  production or transformation may sometimes be found in their annual reports,
  for example. In some cases, researchers may be able to obtain unpublished data
  from state-owned energy enterprises directly.</p>

  <p>Induced transfer are measured by calculating the price-gap between the
  producer or consumer price and a reference price, and multiplying that
  differential by the affected volume produced or consumed. </p>

  <p>Measuring the value of special features introduced into the tax code to
  favour certain industries or activities of those industries (such as
  investment in productive capital) can be a complex endeavour. Some countries
  do this exercise already, and report the annual value of those tax features in
  their periodic tax-expenditure reports. Where that is not the case, the
  analysist must construct a model and estimate the difference in the revenues
  that would be owed to the government under the baseline conditions and with
  the special tax feature.</p>

  <p>Fossil fuel subsidies should be monitored on an annual basis. </p>

  <h2>Rationale:</h2>

  <p>The scale and impact of fossil fuel subsidies presents both challenges and
  opportunities for achieving the goals of the 2030 Agenda on Sustainable
  Development. For one, the use of fossil fuels, and their promotion through
  subsidy schemes, adversely affects the ability of governments to attain key
  goals, such as reducing poverty, improving health, reaching gender equality,
  providing access to energy, and addressing climate change. At the same time,
  there is a need to ensure that poor households that are particularly
  vulnerable to price increases obtain or retain access to energy.
  Energy-dependent sectors of the economy can be affected, particularly by
  abrupt changes in prices. Any successful reform therefore requires careful
  analysis and adapted mitigation measures. For another, reallocating fossil
  fuel subsidies to sectors that are relevant for development could give a boost
  to reaching the SDGs. </p>

  <p>Awareness and understanding of existing subsidies based on credible data is
  necessary to increase transparency and inform decision-making. Reporting
  against a global indicator measuring consumer and producer fossil fuel
  subsidies provides a global picture that encompasses both consumer and
  producer subsidies. It allows for tracking of national and global trends and
  serve as an important guide for policy-making. </p>

  <h2>Comments and limitations:</h2>

  <p>The monitoring and reporting of SDG Indicator 12.c.1 requires capacity
  within national statistical systems to evaluate direct and indirect transfers
  of government funds. Data collection by the statistical agencies from the
  sectoral ministries and state-owned enterprises, including at the sub-national
  level, which depends on their capacity. There is a need for additional
  training materials and sharing of experiences on the indicator.</p>

  <p>The indicator methodology utilizes a phased monitoring to allow for
  countries with different capacities to engage in monitoring 12.c.1. The two
  phases include global monitoring based on price gap estimates plus national
  monitoring of direct and indirect transfers with optional monitoring of tax
  expenditure foregone.</p>
DATA_COMP: >-
  <h1>Methodology</h1>

  <h2>Computation method:</h2>

  <p>It is proposed that countries report on the subsidy categories listed below
  as sub-indicators.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Direct transfers; </li>
    <li>Induced transfers (reporting on regulated prices and calculation of the total amount);</li>
    <li>Tax expenditure, other government revenue foregone and under-pricing of goods and services, including risk (optional). </li>
  </ul>

  <p>The last category should be included as an optional sub-indicator. Each
  sub-indicator should be expressed in national currency or United States
  dollars in current prices. UN Environment will use market exchange rates to
  calculate between national currency and United States dollar. </p>

  <p>Care should be given if a country chooses to aggregate across the three
  sub-indicators in order to avoid double counting and all three sub-indicators
  should be publicly available to ensure transparency. Care needs to be taken
  when aggregating estimates of induced transfers with data on direct transfers
  and some measures in under-pricing of goods and services. </p>

  <p>Estimates of subsidies to consumers observable through price-gaps (i.e.,
  consumer price support) have been calculated by several international
  organizations (IADB, IEA, and IMF), covering different geographic regions and
  time-periods. The three organisations that produce these estimates use roughly
  the same approach, which can be summed up by the following equation:</p>

  <p>Consumer price support = (adjusted net-of-tax reference unit price &#x2013;
  local net-of-tax unit price) x units subsidized</p>

  <p>Estimates are based on reference prices on import (or export) parity prices
  using the price of a product at the nearest international hub, adjusted for
  quality differences if necessary, plus (or minus) the cost of freight and
  insurance to the net importer (or back to the net exporter), plus the cost of
  internal distribution and marketing and any value-added tax (VAT). For
  tradable commodities (mainly coal, crude oil, and petroleum products), the
  reference prices are based on the spot price at the nearest international hub
  &#x2013; e.g., the United States, Northwest Europe, or Singapore.</p>

  <h1>Data availability</h1>

  <h2>Description:</h2>

  <p>An initial baseline data assessment of data availability demonstrates that
  99 countries have existing data which can be used to estimate fossil fuels
  from direct transfer and many of these countries also have information on tax
  revenue foregone. Data on induced transfers using a price gap approach is
  available for all UN member states.</p>

  <h2>Time series:</h2>

  <p>The reporting on this indicator will follow an annual cycle with initial
  reporting on induced transfers starting in 2018. Data on direct transfers and
  tax revenue foregone will be in place by 2020.</p>

  <h2>Disaggregation:</h2>

  <p>Because of the risk of double counting, the dataset should therefore
  provide disaggregated information on individual subsidy measures that will be
  reported as sub-indicators by category of subsidies.</p>
