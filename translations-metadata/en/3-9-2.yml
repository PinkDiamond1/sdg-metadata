  <p><strong>Definition:</strong> </p>

  <p> The mortality rate attributed to unsafe water, unsafe sanitation and lack
  of hygiene (exposure to unsafe Water, Sanitation and Hygiene for All (WASH)
  services) as defined as the number of deaths from unsafe water, unsafe
  sanitation and lack of hygiene (exposure to unsafe WASH services) in a year,
  divided by the population, and multiplied by 100,000. </p>

  <p> </p>

  <p> </p>

  <p><strong>Concepts:</strong> </p>

  <p> Deaths attributable to unsafe water, sanitation and hygiene focusing on
  inadequate WASH services, expressed per 100,000 population; The included
  diseases are the WASH attributable fractions of diarrhoea (ICD-10 code A00,
  A01, A03, A04, A06-A09), intestinal nematode infections (ICD-10 code B76-B77,
  B79) and protein-energy malnutrition (ICD-10 code E40-E46). </p>

  <p> </p>
SOURCE_TYPE: >-
  <p>Data is compiled mainly from country and other databases directly. To
  maximize the data for robust estimates, as well as to reduce duplication of
  data collection to avoid further data reporting burden on countries,
  complementary data are used from various databases. </p>
COLL_METHOD: >-
  <p>WHO conducts a formal country consultation process before releasing its
  cause-of-death estimates. </p>
FREQ_COLL: <p>Ongoing </p>
REL_CAL_POLICY: '<p>2017, first quarter </p>'
DATA_SOURCE: >-
  <p>National statistics offices, Various line ministries and databases covering
  civil registration with complete coverage and medical certification of cause
  of death. </p>
COMPILING_ORG: <p>WHO </p>
RATIONALE: >-
  <p>The indicator expresses the number of deaths from inadequate water,
  sanitation and hygiene (with focus on WASH services) which could be prevented
  by improving those services and practices. It is based on both the WASH
  service provision in the country, as well as the related health outcomes, and
  therefore provides important information on the actual disease caused by the
  risks measured in 6.1, 6.2 and 6.3. </p>
REC_USE_LIM: >-
  <p>Data rely on (a) statistics on WASH services (6.1, 6.2 and 6.3), which are
  well assessed in almost all countries, and (b) data on deaths. Data on deaths
  are also widely available from countries from death registration data or
  sample registration systems, which are certainly feasible systems. Such data
  are crucial for improving health and reducing preventable deaths in countries.
  The main limitation is that not all countries do have such registration
  systems to date, and data need to be completed with other type of information.

  <p>Data are available for practically all countries. They are, however,

  <p>Actual country data for 2010 onwards period </p>

  <p>Asia and Pacific - 27% of countries (16 out of 59 countries, including
  China and India sample systems) </p>

  <p>Africa - 6% of countries (3 out of 54 countries) </p>

  <p>Latin America and the Caribbean - 56% of countries (19 out of 34 countries)

  <p>Europe, North America, Australia, New Zealand and Japan - </p>

  <p>94% of countries (44 out of 47 countries, missing are mainly very small

  <p>The indicator has been established and available for more than a decade.

  <p>WHO has been collating country figures and has been using these to produce
  global and regional estimates against this indicator. </p>

  <p> </p>

  <p><strong>Time series:</strong></p>

  <p>Limited time series data is available (comparable series for years 2012 and
  soon 2015; data for 2002 are also available but have more limited
  comparability) </p>

  <p><strong>Disaggregation:</strong></p>

  <p>Since this indicator is population-based, geographic location is the most
  natural disaggregation. Data also exists for age group and sex. Similar to
  JMP&#x2019;s work on disaggregation by income groups (wealth quintile), data
  can further be disaggregated by wealth quintile. </p>
COMPARABILITY: >-
  <p><strong>Sources of discrepancies:</strong></p>

  <p>WHO is required by World Health Assembly resolution to consult on all WHO
  statistics, and seek feedback from countries on data about countries and
  territories. Before publishing, all estimates undergo country consultations.
