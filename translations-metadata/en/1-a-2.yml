  <p><strong>Definition:</strong></p>

  <p>Total general (local, regional and central) government expenditure on
  education (current, capital, and transfers), expressed as a percentage of
  total general government expenditure on all sectors (including health,
  education, social services, etc.). It includes expenditure funded by transfers
  from international sources to the government.</p>

  <p><strong>Concepts:</strong></p>

  <p>Government expenditure on education covers educational expenditure by all
  levels of government (local, regional, central) on the formal education
  system, from early childhood to tertiary education, in both public and private
  instructional and non-instructional institutions within the borders of a
  country.</p>

  <p>Expenditure on education includes expenditure on core educational goods and
  services, such as teaching staff, school buildings, or school books and
  teaching materials, and peripheral educational goods and services such as
  ancillary services, general administration and other activities.</p>
UNIT_MEASURE: >-
  <p>Percentage. This indicator is the total general government expenditure on
  education, expressed as a percentage of total general government expenditure
  on all sectors. </p>
CLASS_SYSTEM: <p>None</p>
SOURCE_TYPE: >-
  <p>The source of data varies by country depending on the availability:</p>

  <p><strong>For public expenditure on education:</strong> government
  expenditure datasets, expenditure reports in national and sub-national
  budgets, the IMF Government Finance Statistics database, Public Expenditure
  Reviews published by the World Bank and others, the World Bank&#x2019;s BOOST
  dataset, and other national or international sources as available.</p>

  <p><strong>For total government expenditure:</strong> the source of total
  government expenditure would be from a comparable source as the total amount
  of public expenditure on education. For example, if the expenditure amount is
  derived from national budget documents then total expenditure would also be
  derived from national budget documents. </p>

  <p><em>Note that if governments have an official indicator for this SDG, then
  this would be the source.</em></p>
COLL_METHOD: >-
  <p>There are two different methods used to collect data depending on the
  availability of data for a particular country:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Data on education expenditure are submitted by country governments in response to the annual UIS survey on formal education or to the UNESCO-OECD-Eurostat (UOE) data collection. </li>
    <li>If a country does not respond to the annual survey, then data mining of publicly available sources as described above and then an indicator value is estimated based on a modelling approach as needed. </li>
  </ol>
FREQ_COLL: |-
  <ol>
    <li>Annual UIS (usually launched the 4th quarter every year) and UOE survey (usually launched in June every year). </li>
    <li>Data mining is conducted periodically to correspond to the UIS data release schedule</li>
  </ol>
REL_CAL_POLICY: <p>Biannual UIS data release (February and September).</p>
DATA_SOURCE: >-
  <p>Ministries of Finance, Ministries of Education, National Statistical
  Offices.</p>
COMPILING_ORG: '<p>UNESCO Institute for Statistics, OECD, Eurostat</p>'
INST_MANDATE: >-
  <p>The UNESCO Institute for Statistics (UIS) is the statistical branch of the
  United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). The
  Institute produces internationally comparable data and methodologies in the
  fields of education, science, culture and communication for countries at all
  stages of development.</p>

  <p>The <a
  href="https://www.moe.gov.bn/DocumentDownloads/Education%202030/Education2030.pdf"><u>Education
  2030 Framework for Action &#xA7;100</u></a> has clearly stated that:
  &#x201C;<em>In recognition of the importance of harmonization of monitoring
  and reporting, the UIS will remain the official source of cross-nationally
  comparable data on education. It will continue to produce international
  monitoring indicators based on its annual education survey and on other data
  sources that guarantee international comparability for more than 200 countries
  and territories. In addition to collecting data, the UIS will work with
  partners to develop new indicators, statistical approaches and monitoring
  tools to better assess progress across the targets related to UNESCO&#x2019;s
  mandate, working in coordination with the SDG-Education 2030
  SC&#x201D;.</em></p>
RATIONALE: >-
  <p>The indicator is used to assess a government&apos;s emphasis on education
  relative to other sectors. The indicator shows how much of a priority
  education is for a given government, over time or in comparison with other
  countries.</p>
REC_USE_LIM: >-
  <p>A high proportion of government expenditure on education demonstrates a
  high government priority for education relative to other public investments.
  The Education 2030 Framework for Action has endorsed a benchmark for this
  indicator, which encourages countries to allocate at least 15% to 20% of their
  public expenditure to education.</p>

  <p>In some instances data on total public expenditure on education refer only
  to the Ministry of Education, excluding other ministries may also spend a part
  of their budget on educational activities as well as the local governments
  that receive block grants and do not report how much they spend on education.
  Although the IMF aims to publish data on total general government expenditure
  following common definitions based on the Government Finance Statistics
  Manual, in practice this concept (and what it includes) may differ between
  countries.</p>
DATA_COMP: >-
  <p>Total government expenditure on education in all levels combined is
  expressed as a percentage of total general government expenditure (all
  sectors).</p>

  other relevant agencies in individual countries for their review, feedback and
  validation before the publication of the data. </p>
ADJUSTMENT: >-
  <p>Data should cover formal education only and should follow common
  definitions. </p>

  instructions for its completion. </p>
QUALITY_MGMNT: >-
  <p>The UIS maintains a global database used to produce this indicator and
  defines the protocols and standards for data reporting by countries. For
  transparency purposes, the inclusion of a data point in the database is
  completed by following a protocol and is reviewed by UIS technical focal
  points to ensure consistency and overall data quality, based on objective
  criteria to ensure that only the most recent and reliable information are
  included in the database.</p>
QUALITY_ASSURE: >-
  <p>Before its annual data release and the addition of any indicators to the
  global SDG Indicators Database, the UNESCO Institute for Statistics submits
  all indicator values and notes on methodology to National Statistical Offices,
  Ministries of Education or other relevant agencies in individual countries for
  their review and feedback.</p>
QUALITY_ASSMNT: >-
  <p>The indicator should be produced based on consistent and actual data on
  total government expenditures on education and total government expenditures
  on all sectors combined. Criteria for quality assessment include: data sources
  must include proper documentation; data values must be representative at the
  national population level and, if not, should be footnoted; data are plausible
  and based on trends and consistency with previously published/reported values
  for the indicator.</p>
