  least developed countries, to implement programmes and policies to end poverty

  <p><strong>Definition:</strong></p>

  <p>Total general (local, regional and central) government expenditure on
  education (current, capital, and transfers), expressed as a percentage of
  total general government expenditure on all sectors (including health,
  education, social services, etc.). It includes expenditure funded by transfers
  from international sources to the government.</p>

  <p><strong>Concepts:</strong></p>

  <p>Government expenditure on education covers educational expenditure by all
  levels of government (local, regional, central) on the formal education
  system, from early childhood to tertiary education, in both public and private
  instructional and non-instructional institutions within the borders of a
  country.</p>

  <p>Expenditure on education includes expenditure on core educational goods and
  services, such as teaching staff, school buildings, or school books and
  teaching materials, and peripheral educational goods and services such as
  ancillary services, general administration and other activities.</p>
SOURCE_TYPE: >-
  <p>Annual financial reports by national Ministries of Finance or Ministries of
  Education, or national accounts reports by National Statistical Offices.</p>
COLL_METHOD: >-
  <p>Data on education expenditure are submitted by country governments in
  response to the annual UIS survey on formal education or to the
  UNESCO-OECD-Eurostat (UOE) data collection. </p>

  <p>Data on total general government expenditure (all sectors) are obtained
  from the International Monetary Fund&apos;s World Economic Outlook database
  and are updated once a year. </p>
FREQ_COLL: >-
  <p>Annual UIS survey (latest launched in October 2019) and UOE survey (latest
  launched in June 2019).</p>
REL_CAL_POLICY: <p>Biannual UIS data release (February and September).</p>
DATA_SOURCE: >-

  Offices.</p>

  Fund.</p>
INST_MANDATE: >-
  <p>The UNESCO Institute for Statistics (UIS) is the statistical branch of the
  United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). The
  Institute produces internationally comparable data and methodologies in the
  fields of education, science, culture and communication for countries at all
  stages of development.</p>

  <p>The <a
  href="https://www.moe.gov.bn/DocumentDownloads/Education%202030/Education2030.pdf"><u>Education
  2030 Framework for Action 100</u></a> has clearly states that: &#x201C;<em>In
  recognition of the importance of harmonization of monitoring and reporting,
  the UIS will remain the official source of cross-nationally comparable data on
  education. It will continue to produce international monitoring indicators
  based on its annual education survey and on other data sources that guarantee
  international comparability for more than 200 countries and territories. In
  addition to collecting data, the UIS will work with partners to develop new
  indicators, statistical approaches and monitoring tools to better assess
  progress across the targets related to UNESCO&#x2019;s mandate, working in
  coordination with the SDG-Education 2030 SC&#x201D;</em></p>
RATIONALE: >-
  <p>The indicator is used to assess a government&apos;s emphasis on education
  relative to its investments in other sectors. The indicator shows how much of
  a priority education is for a given government, over time or in comparison
  with other countries.</p>
REC_USE_LIM: >-
  <p>A high proportion of government expenditure on education demonstrates a
  high government priority for education relative to other public investments.
  When interpreting this indicator one should keep in mind that some governments
  have more (or fewer) financial resources and therefore larger (or smaller)
  overall budgets, and that countries with younger populations may spend more on
  education relative to other sectors such as health or social security, and
  vice-versa. The Education 2030 Framework for Action has endorsed a benchmark
  for this indicator, which encourages countries to allocate at least 15% to 20%
  of their public expenditure to education.</p>

  <p>In some instances data on total public expenditure on education refer only
  to the Ministry of Education, excluding other ministries may also spend a part
  of their budget on educational activities. Although the IMF aims to publish
  data on total general government expenditure following common definitions
  based on the Government Finance Statistics Manual, in practice this concept
  (and what it includes) may differ between countries.</p>
DATA_COMP: >-
  <p>Total government expenditure for a given level of education (e.g. primary,
  secondary, or all levels combined) is expressed as a percentage of total
  general government expenditure (all sectors).</p>
