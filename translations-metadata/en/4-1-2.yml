  <p><strong>Definition:</strong></p>

  <p>Percentage of a cohort of children or young people aged 3-5 years above the
  intended age for the last grade of each level of education who have completed
  that grade.</p>

  <p><strong>Concepts:</strong></p>

  <p>The intended age for the last grade of each level of education is the age
  at which pupils would enter the grade if they had started school at the
  official primary entrance age, had studied full-time and had progressed
  without repeating or skipping a grade. </p>

  <p>For example, if the official age of entry into primary education is 6
  years, and if primary education has 6 grades, the intended age for the last
  grade of primary education is 11 years. In this case, 14-16 years (11 + 3 = 14
  and 11 + 5 = 16) would be the reference age group for calculation of the
  primary completion rate.</p>
UNIT_MEASURE: <p>Proportion</p>
CLASS_SYSTEM: >-
  <p>The International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED) is used to
  define primary, lower secondary and upper secondary education. </p>
SOURCE_TYPE: >-
  <p>The data can be obtained from population censuses and household surveys
  that collect information on the highest level of education and/or grade
  completed by children and young people in a household. Typical questions in a
  survey to collect data on educational attainment are:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>What is the highest level of education [name of household member] has attended?</li>
    <li>What is the highest grade of education [name of household member] has completed at that level?</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Sources include publicly available data from Demographic and Health Surveys
  (DHS), Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS), European Union Statistics on
  Income and Living Condition (EU-SILC), the Integrated Public Use Microdata
  Series (IPUMS), and national household surveys and censuses.</p>
COLL_METHOD: >-
  <p>Data from all publicly available household surveys and censuses with the
  required information are compiled and used to calculate the completion rate.
  For international comparability, national data are mapped to the ISCED before
  indicator calculation.</p>

  <p>Indicator values intended for dissemination and addition to the global SDG
  Indicators Database are submitted by the UNESCO Institute for Statistics to
  National Statistical Offices, Ministries of Education or other relevant
  agencies in individual countries for their review and feedback.</p>
FREQ_COLL: >-
  <p>Household survey and census datasets are publicly available from the
  sources described above and do not follow any particular release calendar.</p>
REL_CAL_POLICY: >-
  <p>Completion rates are released twice per year by the UNESCO Institute for
  Statistics, around February and September.</p>
DATA_SOURCE: >-
  <p>Household survey and census datasets are publicly available from the
  sources described above and national statistical agencies.</p>
COMPILING_ORG: <p>UNESCO Institute for Statistics.</p>
INST_MANDATE: >-
  <p>The UNESCO Institute for Statistics (UIS) is the statistical branch of the
  United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). The
  Institute produces internationally comparable data and methodologies in the
  fields of education, science, culture and communication for countries at all
  stages of development.</p>

  <p>The <a
  href="https://www.moe.gov.bn/DocumentDownloads/Education%202030/Education2030.pdf"><u>Education
  2030 Framework for Action 100</u></a><u> </u>has clearly states that:
  &#x201C;<em>In recognition of the importance of harmonization of monitoring
  and reporting, the UIS will remain the official source of cross-nationally
  comparable data on education. It will continue to produce international
  monitoring indicators based on its annual education survey and on other data
  sources that guarantee international comparability for more than 200 countries
  and territories. In addition to collecting data, the UIS will work with
  partners to develop new indicators, statistical approaches and monitoring
  tools to better assess progress across the targets related to UNESCO&#x2019;s
  mandate, working in coordination with the SDG-Education 2030
  SC&#x201D;</em></p>
RATIONALE: >-
  <p>The indicator is explicitly referenced in the text of target 4.1:
  &#x2018;ensure that all girls and boys complete [&#x2026;] primary and
  secondary education&#x2019;. A completion rate at or near 100% indicates that
  all or most children and adolescents have completed a level of education by
  the time they are 3 to 5 years older than the official age of entry into the
  last grade of that level of education. A low completion rate indicates low or
  delayed entry into a given level of education, high drop-out, high repetition,
  late completion, or a combination of these factors.</p>

  <p>The completion rate can be used either as a self-standing indicator or in
  combination with SDG indicator 4.1.1 (proportion of children and young people
  (a) in Grade 2 or 3; (b) at the end of primary education; and (c) at the end
  of lower secondary education achieving at least a minimum proficiency level in
  (i) reading and (ii) mathematics). Combining the completion rate with
  indicator 4.1.1 provides information on the percentage of children or young
  people in a cohort who achieve a minimum level of proficiency, and not only on
  the percentage of children in school who achieve minimum proficiency.</p>
REC_USE_LIM: >-
  <p>Three common issues affect the indicator. First, the age group 3-5 years
  above the official age of entry into the last grade for a given level of
  education was selected for the calculation of the completion rate to allow for
  some delayed entry or repetition. In countries where entry can occur very late
  or where repetition is common, some children or adolescents in the age group
  examined may still attend school and the eventual rate of completion may
  therefore be underestimated. Second, as the indicator is calculated from
  household survey data, it is subject to time lag in the availability of data.
  Third, when multiple surveys are available, they may provide conflicting
  information due to the possible presence of sampling and non-sampling errors
  in survey data. </p>

  <p>Responding to a request by the Technical Cooperation Group (TCG) on the
  Indicators for SDG 4 - Education 2030, a refinement of the methodology to
  model completion rate estimates has been developed (Barakat et al. 2021),
  following an approach similar to that used for the estimation of child
  mortality rates. The model ensures that these common challenges with household
  survey data, such as timeliness and sampling or non-sampling errors are
  addressed to provide annual, up-to-date (through short-term projections) and
  more robust data, including for children and youth who complete each level
  later than 3-5 years above the official age of entry into the last grade. </p>
DATA_COMP: >-
  <p>The number of persons in the relevant age group who have completed the last
  grade of a given level of education is divided by the total population (in the
  survey sample) of the same age group.</p>

DATA_VALIDATION: >-
  <p>The completion rate model estimates will be consulted with countries. This
  annual consultation process will give each country&#x2019;s education ministry
  and national statistics office the opportunity to review and provide feedback
  on all data inputs, the estimation methodology and the draft estimates.</p>
ADJUSTMENT: >-
  <p>To take into account countries where the eventual rate of completion is
  underestimated because entry occurs very late or repetition is common,
  estimated completion rates are also available for cohorts of children or young
  people aged up to 8 years above the intended age for the last grade of each
  level of education. </p>
IMPUTATION: >-
  <p>&#x2022; <strong>At country level</strong></p>

  <p>The completion rate can be calculated from older cohorts who are outside of
  the age bracket specified in the definition of the indicator to obtain
  estimates for different years. Gaps in national time series can be imputed
  using the aforementioned model-based to estimate the completion rate.</p>

  <p>&#x2022; <strong>At regional and global levels</strong></p>

  <p>See above.</p>
REG_AGG: >-
  <p>Global and regional estimates of the primary, lower secondary and upper
  secondary completion rate are derived by using the national population in the
  respective age groups as weights for aggregation of national values.</p>
DOC_METHOD: >-
  <p>Countries can calculate the completion rate using the methodology described
  in this document. ISCED mappings that help countries report their data in an
  internationally comparable framework are available on the website of the
  UNESCO Institute for Statistics (<a
  href="http://uis.unesco.org/en/isced-mappings">http://uis.unesco.org/en/isced-mappings</a>).</p>
QUALITY_ASSURE: >-
  <p>The process for quality assurance includes review of survey documentation,
  calculation of measures of reliability, examination of consistency of
  indicator values derived from different sources and, if necessary,
  consultation with data providers.</p>

  <p>Before its annual data release and addition to the global SDG Indicators
  Database, the UNESCO Institute for Statistics submits all indicator values and
  notes on methodology to National Statistical Offices, Ministries of Education
  or other relevant agencies in individual countries for their review and
  feedback.</p>
COVERAGE: >-
  <p><strong>Data availability:</strong></p>

  <p>The primary completion rate is currently available for 150 Member States,
  representing 77% of all Member States worldwide. The lower secondary
  completion rate is available for 155 countries, representing 80% of all Member
  States. Coverage for the upper secondary completion rate is similar, with data
  for 155 countries, representing 80% of all Member States. The countries with
  completion rates are home to more than 90% of the global population.</p>

  <p><strong>Time series:</strong></p>

  <p>The completion rate is available for the years since 2000. National time
  series of raw data are incomplete due to the infrequent implementation of
  household surveys and censuses but <a id="OLE_LINK512"></a><a
  id="OLE_LINK513"></a>time series without gaps are available through the
  aforementioned reconstructed model-based estimates of the completion rate.</p>

  <p><strong>Disaggregation:</strong></p>

  <p>The indicator is disaggregated by sex, location, wealth and other
  dimensions specified in global indicator 4.5.1 (parity index). Model-based
  estimates are disaggregated by sex.</p>
COMPARABILITY: >-
  <p><strong>Sources of discrepancies:</strong></p>

  <p>National data are often collected and reported in reference to national
  systems of education. The mapping from a national classification to the
  International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED) is not always
  straightforward and can cause discrepancies between national and international
  indicator estimates. Additional discrepancies can arise between single point
  in time estimates from a single source and model estimates, which use
  efficiently multiple sources. </p>
