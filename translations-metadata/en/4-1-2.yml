  <p>Definition:</p>

  <p>Percentage of a cohort of children or young people aged 3-5 years above the
  intended age for the last grade of each level of education who have completed
  that grade.</p>

  <p>Concepts:</p>

  <p>The intended age for the last grade of each level of education is the age
  at which pupils would enter the grade if they had started school at the
  official primary entrance age, had studied full-time and had progressed
  without repeating or skipping a grade. </p>

  <p>For example, if the official age of entry into primary education is 6
  years, and if primary education has 6 grades, the intended age for the last
  grade of primary education is 11 years. In this case, 14-16 years (11 + 3 = 14
  and 11 + 5 = 16) would be the reference age group for calculation of the
  primary completion rate.</p>

SOURCE_TYPE: >-
  <p>The data can be obtained from population censuses and household surveys
  that collect information on the highest level of education completed by
  children and young people in a household. Typical questions in a survey to
  collect data on educational attainment are:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>What is the highest level of education [name of household member] has attended?</li>
    <li>What is the highest grade of education [name of household member] has completed at that level?</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Sources include publicly available data from Demographic and Health Surveys
  (DHS), Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS), European Union Statistics on
  Income and Living Condition (EU-SILC), the Integrated Public Use Microdata
  Series (IPUMS), and national household surveys and censuses.</p>
COLL_METHOD: >-
  <p>Data from all publicly available household surveys and censuses with the
  required information are compiled and used to calculate the completion rate.
  For international comparability, national data are mapped to the International
  Standard Classification of Education (ISCED) before indicator calculation.</p>

  <p>Indicator values intended for dissemination and addition to the global SDG
  Indicators Database are submitted by the UNESCO Institute for Statistics to
  National Statistical Offices, Ministries of Education or other relevant
  agencies in individual countries for their review and feedback.</p>

RATIONALE: >-
  <p>The indicator is explicitly referenced in the text of target 4.1:
  &#x2018;ensure that all girls and boys complete [&#x2026;] primary and
  secondary education&#x2019;. A completion rate at or near 100% indicates that
  all or most children and adolescents have completed a level of education by
  the time they are 3 to 5 years older than the official age of entry into the
  last grade of that level of education. A low completion rate indicates low or
  delayed entry into a given level of education, high drop-out, high repetition,
  late completion, or a combination of these factors.</p>

  <p>The completion rate can be used either as a self-standing indicator or in
  combination with SDG indicator 4.1.1 (proportion of children and young people
  (a) in Grade 2 or 3; (b) at the end of primary education; and (c) at the end
  of lower secondary education achieving at least a minimum proficiency level in
  (i) reading and (ii) mathematics). Combining the completion rate with
  indicator 4.1.1 provides information on the percentage of children or young
  people in a cohort who achieve a minimum level of proficiency, and not only on
  the percentage of children in school who achieve minimum proficiency.</p>
REC_USE_LIM: >-
  <p>The age group 3-5 years above the official age of entry into the last grade
  for a given level of education was selected for the calculation of the
  completion rate to allow for some delayed entry or repetition. In countries
  where entry can occur very late or where repetition is common, some children
  or adolescents in the age group examined may still attend school and the
  eventual rate of completion may therefore be underestimated.</p>

  <p>The indicator is calculated from household survey data and is subject to
  time lag in the availability of data. When multiple surveys are available,
  they may provide conflicting information due to the possible presence of
  sampling and non-sampling errors in survey data. The Technical Cooperation
  Group on the Indicators for SDG 4 - Education 2030 (TCG) has requested a
  refinement of the methodology to model completion rate estimates, following an
  approach similar to that used for the estimation of child mortality rates. The
  model would ensure that common challenges with household survey data, such as
  timeliness and sampling or non-sampling errors are addressed to provide
  up-to-date and more robust data.</p>
DATA_COMP: >-
  <p>The number of persons in the relevant age group who have completed the last
  grade of a given level of education is divided by the total population (in the
  survey sample) of the same age group.</p>

  <p>Formula:</p>

  <p>where:</p>

  <p> completion rate for level n of education</p>

  <p> population aged 3 to 5 years above the official entrance age a into the
  last grade of level n of education who completed level n</p>

  <p> population aged 3 to 5 years above the official entrance age a into the
  last grade of level n of education</p>

  (upper secondary education)</p>

IMPUTATION: >-
  <p>&#x2022; At country level</p>

  <p>The completion rate can be calculated from older cohorts who are outside of
  the age bracket specified in the definition of the indicator to obtain
  estimates for different years. Gaps in national time series can also be
  imputed. using the aforementioned model-based to estimate the completion
  rate.</p>

  <p>&#x2022; At regional and global levels</p>

  <p>See above.</p>
REG_AGG: >-
  <p>Global and regional estimates of the primary, lower secondary and upper
  secondary completion rate are derived by using the national population in the
  respective age groups as weights for aggregation of national values.</p>
DOC_METHOD: >-
  <p>Countries can calculate the completion rate using the methodology described
  in this document. ISCED mappings that help countries report their data in an
  internationally comparable framework are available on the website of the
  UNESCO Institute for Statistics (<a

QUALITY_MGMNT: ''
QUALITY_ASSURE: >-
  <p>The process for quality assurance includes review of survey documentation,
  calculation of measures of reliability, examination of consistency of
  indicator values derived from different sources and, if necessary,
  consultation with data providers.</p>

  <p>Before its annual data release and addition to the global SDG Indicators
  Database, the UNESCO Institute for Statistics submits all indicator values and
  notes on methodology to National Statistical Offices, Ministries of Education
  or other relevant agencies in individual countries for their review and
  feedback.</p>

COVERAGE: >-
  <p>Data availability:</p>

  <p>The primary completion rate is currently available for 122 countries,
  representing 51% of all countries worldwide. The lower secondary completion
  rate is available for 155 countries, representing 64% of all countries.
  Coverage for the upper secondary completion rate is similar, with data for 155
  countries, representing 64% of all countries. The countries with completion
  rates are home to more than 90% of the global population.</p>

  <p>Time series:</p>

  <p>The completion rate is available for the years since 2000. National time
  series are incomplete due to the infrequent implementation of household
  surveys and censuses but could, potentially, be reconstructed using the
  aforementioned model-based to estimate the completion rate..</p>

  <p>Disaggregation:</p>

  <p>The indicator is disaggregated by sex, location, wealth and other
  dimensions specified in global indicator 4.5.1 (parity index).</p>
COMPARABILITY: >-
  <p>Sources of discrepancies:</p>

  <p>National data are often collected and reported in reference to national
  systems of education. The mapping from a national classification to the
  International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED) is not always
  straightforward and can cause discrepancies between national and international
  indicator estimates.</p>
