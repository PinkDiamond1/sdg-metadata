  <p><strong>Definition:</strong></p>

  <p>Parity indices require data for the specific groups of interest. They
  represent the ratio of the indicator value for one group to that of the other.
  Typically, the likely more disadvantaged group is placed in the numerator. A
  value of exactly 1 indicates parity between the two groups.</p>

  <p><strong>Concepts:</strong></p>

  <p>See metadata for relevant underlying indicator.</p>
UNIT_MEASURE: >-
  <p>Ratio. This indicator is expressed as the ratio of the value of the
  indicator for the likely more disadvantaged group to that of the likely more
  advantaged group. </p>
CLASS_SYSTEM: <p>Not applicable </p>
SOURCE_TYPE: >-
  <p>The sources are the same as for the underlying indicators for this
  goal.</p>
COLL_METHOD: <p>The same as the underlying indicator. </p>

COMPILING_ORG: <p>UNESCO Institute for Statistics (UIS)</p>
INST_MANDATE: >-
  <p>The UNESCO Institute for Statistics (UIS) is the statistical branch of the
  United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). The
  Institute produces internationally comparable data and methodologies in the
  fields of education, science, culture and communication for countries at all
  stages of development.</p>

  <p>The <a
  href="https://www.moe.gov.bn/DocumentDownloads/Education%202030/Education2030.pdf"><u>Education
  2030 Framework for Action &#xA7;100</u></a> has clearly stated that:
  &#x201C;<em>In recognition of the importance of harmonization of monitoring
  and reporting, the UIS will remain the official source of cross-nationally
  comparable data on education. It will continue to produce international
  monitoring indicators based on its annual education survey and on other data
  sources that guarantee international comparability for more than 200 countries
  and territories. In addition to collecting data, the UIS will work with
  partners to develop new indicators, statistical approaches and monitoring
  tools to better assess progress across the targets related to UNESCO&#x2019;s
  mandate, working in coordination with the SDG-Education 2030
  SC&#x201D;.</em></p>
RATIONALE: >-
  <p>To measure the general level of disparity between two sub-populations of
  interest with regard to a given indicator. The further from 1 the parity index
  lies, the greater the disparity between the two groups of interest.</p>
REC_USE_LIM: >-
  <p>The indicator is not symmetrical about 1 but a simple transformation can
  make it so (by inverting ratios that exceed 1 and subtracting them from 2).
  This will make interpretation easier.</p>
DATA_COMP: >-
  <p>The indicator value of the likely more disadvantaged group is divided by
  the indicator value of the other sub-population of interest. </p>
