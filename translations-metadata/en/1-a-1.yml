  <h2>Definition:</h2>

  <p>Total official development assistance (ODA) grants from all donors that
  focus on poverty reduction as a share of the recipient country&#x2019;s gross
  national income. </p>

  <p>The OECD/Development Assistance Committee (DAC) defines ODA as
  &#x201C;flows to countries and territories on the DAC List of ODA Recipients
  and to multilateral institutions which are i) provided by official agencies,
  including state and local governments, or by their executive agencies; and ii)
  each transaction is administered with the promotion of the economic
  development and welfare of developing countries as its main objective; and is
  concessional in character and conveys a grant element of at least 25 per cent
  (calculated at a rate of discount of 10 per cent). (See <a
  href="http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/officialdevelopmentassistancedefinitionandcoverage.htm">http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/officialdevelopmentassistancedefinitionandcoverage.htm</a>).</p>

  <p>Poverty reduction items can be defined as ODA to basic social services
  (basic health, basic education, basic water and sanitation, population
  programmes and reproductive health) and developmental food aid (see here: <a
  href="http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/purposecodessectorclassification.htm">http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/purposecodessectorclassification.htm</a>).</p>

  <p>Basic social services and development food aid, which focus on poverty
  reduction, are defined using the following OECD Creditor Reporting System
  purpose codes, which identify the sector the activity is intended to target:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Basic Education (CRS codes 112xx)</li>
    <li>Basic Health (CRS codes (122xx)</li>
    <li>Water Supply and Sanitation (CRS codes 140xx)</li>
    <li>Multisector aid for basic social services (CRS code 16050)</li>
    <li>Development Food Aid (CRS code 52010)</li>
  </ul>

  <h1>Data sources</h1>

  <h2>Description:</h2>

  <p>The OECD/DAC has been collecting data on official and private resource
  flows, from 1960 at an aggregate level, and 1973 at an activity level through
  the Creditor Reporting System (CRS data are considered complete from 1995 for
  commitments at an activity level and 2002 for disbursements). </p>

  <p>The data are reported by donors according to the same standards and
  methodologies (see here: <a
  href="http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/methodology.htm">http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/methodology.htm</a>).
  </p>

  <p>Data are reported on an annual calendar year basis by statistical reporters
  in national administrations (aid agencies, Ministries of Foreign Affairs or
  Finance, etc.)</p>
COLL_METHOD: >-
  <h2>Collection process:</h2>

  <p>A statistical reporter is responsible for the collection of DAC statistics
  in each providing country/agency. This reporter is usually located in the
  national aid agency, Ministry of Foreign Affairs or Finance etc.</p>

  <p>The OECD prepares and sends a questionnaire on aid flows (at an activity
  level and aggregate level) to the national statistical reporter every year.

  <p>Data collection is annual. Detailed 2019 flows will be published in
  December 2020.</p>

  <h2>Rationale:</h2>

  <p>Total ODA flows to developing countries quantify the public effort
  (excluding non- concessional flows and export credits), that all donors
  provide for the economic development and welfare of developing countries.
  Within ODA, basic social services and development food aid focus on poverty
  alleviation in developing countries.</p>
REC_USE_LIM: >-
  <h2>Comments and limitations:</h2>

  <p>Data in the Creditor Reporting System (i.e. at an activity level), are
  available from 1973 onwards. However, the data coverage is considered complete
  since 1995 for commitments and 2002 for disbursements.</p>

  <h1>Methodology</h1>

  <h2>Computation method:</h2>

  <p><strong>From a donor country&#x2019;s perspective</strong>: The sum of
  bilateral ODA grants by donor that focus on poverty reduction as a share of
  the donor country&#x2019;s gross national income. </p>

  <p><strong>From a recipient country&#x2019;s perspective</strong>: The sum of
  total ODA grants from all donors (i.e. DAC donors, multilateral organisations
  and other bilateral providers of development cooperation) that focus on
  poverty reduction as a share of the developing country&#x2019;s gross national
  income. </p>

  <h2>Methods and guidance available to countries for the compilation of the

  <p>The DAC statistical Reporting Directives govern the reporting of DAC
  statistics, and are reviewed and agreed by the DAC Working Party of
  Development Finance Statistics, see: <a

  <h1>Data availability</h1>

  <h2>Description:</h2>

  <p>Data are published on an annual basis in December for flows in the previous
  year.</p>

  <p>Provisional data classification: Tier I</p>

  <h2>Time series:</h2>

  <p>The OECD/DAC has been collecting data on official and private resource
  flows, from 1960 at an aggregate level, and 1973 at an activity level through
  the Creditor Reporting System (CRS data are considered complete from 1995 for

  of finance, by type of aid, by sub-sector, by policy marker (e.g. gender),
  etc.</p>
