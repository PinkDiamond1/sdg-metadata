  <p>Mortality rate attributed to cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes or
  chronic respiratory disease. </p>

  <p>Probability of dying between the ages of 30 and 70 years from
  cardiovascular diseases, cancer, diabetes or chronic respiratory diseases,
  defined as the per cent of 30-year-old-people who would die before their 70th
  birthday from cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes, or chronic respiratory
  disease, assuming that s/he would experience current mortality rates at every
  age and s/he would not die from any other cause of death (e.g., injuries or
  HIV/AIDS). This indicator is calculated using life table methods (see further
  details in section 3.3). </p>

  <p> </p>

  <p>Concepts:</p>

  <p> </p>

  <p>Probability of dying: The likelihood that an individual would die between
  two ages given current mortality rates at each age, calculated using life
  table methods. The probability of death between two ages may be called a
  mortality rate. </p>

  <p> </p>

  <p>Life table: A table showing the mortality experience of a hypothetical
  group of infants born at the same time and subject throughout their lifetime
  to a set of age-specific mortality rates. </p>

  <p> </p>

  <p>Cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes or chronic respiratory diseases:
  ICD-10 underlying causes of death I00-I99, COO-C97, E10-E14 and J30-J98. </p>
UNIT_MEASURE: <p>Probability</p>
CLASS_SYSTEM: >-
  <p>The four noncommunicable causes of death are defined in terms of the
  International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) (See
  2.a)</p>
SOURCE_TYPE: >-
  <p>The preferred data source is death registration systems with complete
  coverage and medical certification of cause of death. Other possible data
  sources include household surveys with verbal autopsy, and sample or sentinel
  registration systems. </p>
COLL_METHOD: >-
  <p>WHO conducts a formal country consultation process before releasing its
  cause-of-death estimates. </p>

  <p> </p>
FREQ_COLL: >-
  <p>WHO annually requests tabulated death registration data (including all
  causes of death) from Member States. Countries may submit annual
  cause-of-death statistics to WHO on an ongoing basis. </p>
REL_CAL_POLICY: <p>End of 2020. </p>
DATA_SOURCE: <p>National statistics offices and/or ministries of health. </p>
COMPILING_ORG: <p>WHO </p>
INST_MANDATE: >-
  <p>According to Article 64 of its constitution, WHO is mandated to request
  each Member State to provide statistics on mortality. Furthermore, the WHO
  Nomenclature Regulations of 1967 affirms the importance of compiling and
  publishing statistics of mortality and morbidity in comparable form. Member
  States started to report mortality data to WHO since the early fifties and
  this reporting activity is continuing until today. </p>
RATIONALE: >-
  <p>Disease burden from non-communicable diseases (NCDs) among adults is
  rapidly increasing globally due to ageing and epidemiological transitions.
  Cardiovascular diseases, cancer, diabetes and chronic respiratory diseases are
  the four main causes of NCD burden. Measuring the risk of dying from these
  four major causes is important to assess the extent of burden from premature
  mortality due NCDs in a population. </p>
REC_USE_LIM: >-
  <p>Cause of death estimates have large uncertainty ranges for some causes and
  some regions. Data gaps and limitations in high-mortality regions reinforce
  the need for caution when interpreting global comparative cause of death
  assessments, as well as the need for increased investment in population health
  measurement systems. The use of verbal autopsy methods in sample registration
  systems, demographic surveillance systems and household surveys provides some
  information on causes of death in populations without well-functioning death
  registration systems, but there remain considerable challenges in the
  validation and interpretation of such data, and in the assessment of
  uncertainty associated with diagnoses of underlying cause of death. </p>
DATA_COMP: >-
  <p>The methods used for the analysis of causes of death depend on the type of
  data available from countries: </p>

  <p> </p>

  <p>For countries with a high-quality vital registration system including
  information on cause of death, the vital registration that member states
  submit to the WHO Mortality Database were used, with adjustments where
  necessary, e.g. for under-reporting of deaths, unknown age and sex, and
  ill-defined causes of deaths. </p>

  <p> </p>

  <p>For countries without high-quality death registration data, cause of death
  estimates are calculated using other data, including household surveys with
  verbal autopsy, sample or sentinel registration systems, special studies and
  surveillance systems. In most cases, these data sources are combined in a
  modelling framework. </p>

  <p> </p>

  <p>The probability of dying between ages 30 and 70 years from the four main
  NCDs was estimated using age-specific death rates of the combined four main
  NCD categories. Using the life table method, the risk of death between the
  exact ages of 30 and 70, from any of the four causes and in the absence of
  other causes of death, was calculated using the equation .provided in the
  document below. The ICD codes used are: Cardiovascular disease: I00-I99,
  Cancer: C00-C97, Diabetes: E10-E14, and Chronic respiratory disease: J30-J98
  </p>

  <p>Formulas to (1) calculate age-specific mortality rate for each five-year
  age group between 30 and 70, (2) translate the 5-year death rate into the
  probability of death in each 5-year age range, and (3) calculate the
  probability of death from age 30 to age 70, independent of other causes of
  death, can be found on page 6 of this document: </p>

DATA_VALIDATION: >-
  <p>The number of deaths were country consulted with country designated focal
  points (usually at the Ministry of Health or National Statistics Office) as
  part of the full set of causes of death prior to the release.</p>
ADJUSTMENT: >-
  <p>Deaths of unknown sex were redistributed pro-rata within cause-age groups
  of known sexes, and then deaths of unknown age were redistributed pro-rata
  within cause-sex groups of known ages.</p>
IMPUTATION: >-
  <ul>
    <li>At country level </li>
  </ul>

  <p> </p>

  <p>For countries with high-quality cause-of-death statistics,
  interpolation/extrapolation was done for missing country-years; for countries
  with only low-quality or no data on causes of death, modelling was used.

DOC_METHOD: >-
  <p>The cause of death categories (including suicides) follow the definitions
  in terms of the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision
  (ICD-10). Please see Annex Table A of the WHO methods and data sources for
  global causes of death, 2000&#x2013;2019

QUALITY_MGMNT: >-
  <p>The World Health Organization (WHO) established a Reference Group on Health
  Statistics in 2013 to provide advice on population health statistics to WHO
  with a focus on methodological and data issues related to the measurement of
  mortality and cause-of-death patterns. The group facilitated interaction
  between multilateral development institutions and other independent academic
  groups with WHO expert groups in specific subject areas including methods to
  the estimation on causes of death</p>
QUALITY_ASSURE: >-
  <p>The data principles of the World Health Organization (WHO) provide a
  foundation for continually reaffirming trust in WHO&#x2019;s information and
  evidence on public health. The five principles are designed to provide a
  framework for data governance for WHO. The principles are intended primarily
  for use by WHO staff across all parts of the Organization in order to help
  define the values and standards that govern how data that flows into, across
  and out of WHO is collected, processed, shared and used. These principles are
  made publicly available so that they may be used and referred to by Member
  States and non-state actors collaborating with WHO.</p>
QUALITY_ASSMNT: >-
  <p>All statements and claims made officially by WHO headquarters about
  population-level (country, regional, global) estimates of health status (e.g.
  mortality, incidence, prevalence, burden of disease), are cleared by the
  Department of Data and Analytics (DNA) through the executive clearance
  process. This includes the GATHER statement. GATHER promotes best practices in
  reporting health estimates using a checklist of 18 items that should be
  reported every time new global health estimates are published, including
  descriptions of input data and estimation methods. Developed by a working
  group convened by the World Health Organization, the guidelines aim to define
  and promote good practice in reporting health estimates.</p>
COVERAGE: >-
  <p>Data availability: </p>

  <p>Almost 70 countries currently provide WHO with regular high-quality data on
  mortality by age, sex and causes of death, and another 58 countries submit
  data of lower quality. However, comprehensive cause-of-death estimates are
  calculated by WHO systematically for all of its Member States (with a certain
  population threshold).</p>

  <p>Time series: 2000-2019</p>

  <p>Disaggregation: </p>

  <p>Sex </p>
COMPARABILITY: >-
  <p>Sources of discrepancies:</p>

  <p>In countries with high quality vital registration systems, point estimates
  sometimes differ primarily for two reasons: 1) WHO redistributes deaths with
  ill-defined cause of death; and 2) WHO corrects for incomplete death
  registration. </p>
