  <h2>Definition:</h2>

  <h2>The indicator reflects the proportion of persons effectively covered by a
  social protection system, including social protection floors. It also reflects
  the main components of social protection: child and maternity benefits,
  support for persons without a job, persons with disabilities, victims of work
  injuries and older persons. </h2>

  <h2>Effective coverage of social protection is measured by the number of
  people who are either actively contributing to a social insurance scheme or
  receiving benefits (contributory or non-contributory).</h2>

  <h2><br>Concepts: </h2>

  <p>Social protection systems include contributory and non-contributory schemes
  for children, pregnant women with newborns, people in active age, older
  persons, for victims of work injuries and persons with disabilities. Social
  protection floors provide at least a basic level in all main contingencies
  along the life cycle, as defined in the Social Protection Floors
  Recommendation 2012 (no. 202) referred to in SDG 1.3. </p>

  <p>When assessing coverage and gaps in coverage, distinctions need to be made
  between coverage by (1) contributory social insurance, (2) universal schemes
  covering all residents (or all residents in a given category), and (3)
  means-tested schemes potentially covering all those who pass the required test
  of income and/or assets.</p>

CLASS_SYSTEM: >-
  <p>Social protection functions specified under: Convention 102 Social Security
  (Minimum Standards) Convention, 1952, and Resolution concerning the
  development of social security statistics, adopted by the Ninth International
  Conference of Labour Statisticians.</p>
SRC_TYPE_COLL_METHOD: ''
SOURCE_TYPE: >-
  <p>The main data source is the <strong>Social Security Inquiry (online
  questionnaire </strong><a
  href="https://qpss.ilo.org/"><strong>https://qpss.ilo.org/</strong></a><strong>)</strong>,
  the ILO&#x2019;s periodic collection of administrative data from national
  ministries of labour, social security, welfare, finance, and others.</p>

  <p>Since 1950, the ILO&#x2019;s Social Security Inquiry has been the main
  global source of administrative data on social protection. Secondary data
  sources include existing global databases of social protection statistics,
  including those of the World Bank, UNICEF, UNWOMEN, HELPAGE, OECD and the
  International Social Security Association. </p>

  <p>This forms the <strong>World Social Protection Database</strong>. It
  provides a unique source of information and serves as the basis for the ILO
  flagship World Social Protection Report, which periodically presents
  development trends of social protection systems, including floors, providing
  data for a wide range of countries (214 countries and territories). </p>
COLL_METHOD: >-
  <h2>Obtaining internationally comparable data for global monitoring</h2>

  <p>Data is collected using the SSI questionnaires, which are filled in direct
  collaboration with government agencies - Ministries of labour, ministries of
  finance, social protection institutions and others. The collected data
  collected is revised by the Social Protection Department in order to identify
  internal inconsistencies between data and indicators, and detect major
  differences regarding indicators calculated in previous years. When
  significant discrepancies are detected, the questionnaires are sent back to
  the countries, including detailed comments, for further revision and
  adjustments. In many cases direct contact with national counterparts are
  required, as SSI application lies on a strong coordination with our
  governmental counterparts. </p>

INST_MANDATE: >-
  <p>Data compilation on the functioning of social security/social protection
  systems and monitoring progress are the responsibilities undertaken by the ILO
  in view of its mandate to assess the compliance with international standards
  in this field, in particular the conventions and recommendations on social
  security adopted by the member States of the ILO. </p>

  <h2>Rationale and interpretation:</h2>

  <p>Access to at least a basic level of social protection throughout the life
  cycle is a human right. The principle of universality of social protection
  evidences the importance of social protection systems in guaranteeing decent
  living conditions to the whole population, throughout their lives. The
  proportion of the population covered by social protection systems/floors
  provides an indication of the extent to which universality is accomplished,
  and thus, how secure are the population&apos;s living conditions.</p>

  <p>Measurements of <strong>effective coverage</strong> should reflect how in
  reality legal provisions are implemented. </p>

  <p>It refers to the percentage of people actually receiving benefits of
  contributory and non-contributory social protection programmes, plus the
  number of persons actively contributing to social insurance schemes.</p>
REC_USE_LIM: >-
  <p>Data is collected through an administrative survey ongoing for decades, the
  ILO Social Security Inquiry. Whenever countries provide data, the indicator is
  disaggregated by sex. Indicators disaggregated by country and region are also
  available.</p>
DATA_COMP: >-
  <p>Calculations include separate indicators in order to distinguish effective
  coverage for children, unemployed persons, older persons and persons with
  disabilities, mothers with newborns, workers protected in case of work injury,
  and the poor and the vulnerable. For each case, coverage expressed as a share
  of the respective population.</p>

  <p>Indicators are obtained as follows:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Proportion of population covered by at least one social protection cash benefit: ratio of the population receiving cash benefits under at least one of the contingencies/social protection function (contributory or non-contributory benefit) or actively contributing to at least one social security scheme to the total population.</li>
    <li>Proportion of children covered by social protection benefits: ratio of children/households receiving child or family cash benefits to the total number of children/households with children.</li>
    <li>Proportion of women giving birth covered by maternity benefits: ratio of women receiving cash maternity benefits to women giving birth in the same year (estimated based on age-specific fertility rates published in the UN&#x2019;s World Population Prospects or on the number of live births corrected for the share of twin and triplet births).</li>
    <li>Proportion of persons with disabilities receiving benefits: ratio of persons receiving disability cash benefits to persons with severe disabilities. The latter is calculated as the product of prevalence of disability ratios (published for each country group by the World Health Organization) and each country&#x2019;s population.</li>
    <li>Proportion of unemployed receiving benefits: ratio of recipients of unemployment cash benefits to the number of unemployed persons.</li>
    <li>Proportion of workers covered in case of employment injury: ratio of workers protected by injury insurance to total employment or the labour force. </li>
    <li>Proportion of older persons receiving a pension: ratio of persons above statutory retirement age receiving an old-age pension to persons above statutory retirement age (including contributory and non-contributory).</li>
    <li>Proportion of vulnerable persons receiving benefits: ratio of social assistance recipients to the total number of vulnerable persons. The latter are calculated by subtracting from total population all people of working age who are contributing to a social insurance scheme or receiving contributory benefits, and all persons above retirement age receiving contributory benefits.</li>
    <li>Proportion of poor population receiving social assistance cash benefit: ratio of social assistance recipients to the population living below the national poverty line.</li>

DATA_VALIDATION: >-
  <p>Valdiation is organized through the ILO regional and country offices with
  the Ministry of Labour or another institution that serves as a focal point in
  the country.</p>
ADJUSTMENT: <p>Not applicable.</p>
IMPUTATION: >-
  <p>&#x2022; At country level</p>

  <p>Indicators for countries with missing values are not part of the
  reporting.</p>

  <p>&#x2022; At regional and global levels</p>

  <p>For SDG regions with insufficient country coverage, imputations are
  used.</p>
REG_AGG: >-
  <p>Global and regional indicators are weighted averages of national indicators
  with weights equal to the denominators indicated in section 3.3, a-g. Global
  and regional estimates are based on econometric models designed to impute
  missing data in countries for which nationally-reported data are unavailable.
  The output of the models is a complete set of single-year estimates for seven
  social protection indicators for 169 countries. The country-level data
  (reported and imputed) are then aggregated to produce global and regional
  estimates of the social protection indicators.</p>
DOC_METHOD: >-
  <p>The ILO&#x2019;s Social Security Inquiry is used at the national level to
  compile the data. All the relevant information (questionnaire, technical
  guide, etc) can be obtained here: <a

  </p>
QUALITY_MGMNT: >-
  <p>The processes of compilation, analysis and publication of social protection
  data, including its quality control, are carried out following the
  methodological framework and standards established by the ILO Department of
  Statistics, in compliance with the information technology and management
  standards of the ILO.</p>
QUALITY_ASSURE: >-
  <p>The compilation of social protection data is based on the ongoing
  implementation of SSI at the country level. The cycle of application and
  processing of data, information and indicators from the SSI is carried out in
  close coordination with the government offices of the countries concerned,
  with technical supervision by ILO specialists in the field offices. The
  information collected at the country level through the SSI is complemented
  with information from other national sources in order to calculate a set of
  variables and indicators that make up the World Social Protection Database.
  Quality control practices include consultations with the government agencies
  providing the information, comparisons with the values of the variables and
  indicators obtained in previous years, and application of a set of calculation
  and verification algorithms. </p>
QUALITY_ASSMNT: >-
  <p>The final assessment of the quality of social protection information is
  carried out by the Public Finance, Actuarial and Statistics Unit of the
  ILO&apos;s Social Protection Department. This process follows the standard
  quality criteria established by the ILO Department of Statistics. In case of
  doubts about the quality of specific data, these values are reviewed with the
  participation of the national agencies responsible for producing social
  protection data. If the issues cannot be clarified, the respective information
  is not published. </p>
