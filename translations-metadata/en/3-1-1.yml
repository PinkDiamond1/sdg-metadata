  <p><strong>Definition:</strong></p>

  <p>The maternal mortality ratio (MMR) is defined as the number of maternal
  deaths during a given time period per 100,000 live births during the same time
  period. It depicts the risk of maternal death relative to the number of live
  births and essentially captures the risk of death in a single pregnancy
  (proxied by a single live birth).</p>

  <p><strong>Concepts:</strong></p>

  <p>In the <em>International statistical classification of diseases and related
  health problems (ICD) </em>WHO defines the following:</p>

  <p><strong>Maternal death</strong>: The death of a woman while pregnant or
  within 42 days of termination of pregnancy, irrespective of the duration and
  site of the pregnancy, from any cause related to or aggravated by the
  pregnancy or its management (from direct or indirect obstetric death), but not
  from unintentional or incidental causes.</p>

  <p>A death occurring during pregnancy, childbirth and puerperium (also
  known</p>

  <p>as a <strong>pregnancy-related death</strong>): The death of a woman while
  pregnant or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy, irrespective of the
  cause of death.</p>
UNIT_MEASURE: '<p>Ratio: number of maternal deaths expressed per 100,000 live births</p>'
CLASS_SYSTEM: >-
  <p>Maternal deaths are classified according to the <em>International
  statistical classification of diseases and related health problems</em> (ICD)
  definition. The specific codes used under ICD-10 (the 10<sup>th</sup> revision
  of the ICD) to define a maternal death are: O00-O96; O98, O99 and A34.</p>

  <p>ICD-11 (the 11th revision of the ICD) was adopted by the World Health
  Assembly in May 2019 and comes into effect on 1<sup>st</sup> January 2022.
  Further information is available at: <a
  href="http://www.who.int/classifications/icd/en/">www.who.int/classifications/icd/en/</a>
  The coding rules related to maternal mortality are being edited to fully match
  the new structure of ICD-11, but without changing the resulting statistics.
  The ICD-11 rules can be accessed in the reference guide of ICD-11, at <a
  href="https://icd.who.int">https://icd.who.int</a> . Forthcoming releases from
  2022 onwards will transition to use ICD-11 coding. Care has been taken to
  ensure that the definition of maternal death used for international comparison
  of mortality statistics remains stable over time, but the word
  &#x201C;unintentional&#x201D; has been used in the ICD-11 definition in place
  of the word &#x201C;accidental&#x201D; which was previously used, in
  ICD-10.</p>

  <p>The United Nations Maternal Mortality Estimation Inter-Agency Group (UN
  MMEIG) &#x2013; comprising WHO, UNICEF, UNFPA, the World Bank Group and the
  United Nations Population Division (UNPD) of the Department of Economic and
  Social Affairs (MMEIG) maintains an input database consisting of maternal
  mortality data from civil registration, population-based surveys, surveillance
  systems, censuses, and other specialized studies/surveys. This database is
  used to calculate the proportion of maternal deaths (PM) among women of
  reproductive age (WRA). The MMR is then calculated as MMR = PM(D/B); where
  &quot;D&quot; is the number of all-cause deaths among women WRA and
  &quot;B&quot; is the number of live births. The number of live births is based
  upon the World Population Prospects published by UNDP. </p>

  <p>Statistical modelling is undertaken to generate comparable country,
  regional, and global level estimates. Adjustments are made according to the
  data source type (See Section 4e below). The analysis accounts for stochastic
  errors, sampling error in the data source, errors during data collection and
  processing, and other random error. The model&apos;s fit is assessed by
  cross-validation.</p>
FREQ_COLL: >-
  <p>The input datasets are updated prior to each new publication round of the
  MMR estimates. Source data are collected by countries, typically annually for
  CRVS sources, every 3-5 years for specialized reviews, every 5-7 years for
  population-based surveys, and every 10 years for censuses. </p>

  <p> </p>
INST_MANDATE: <p>WHO is the custodian UN agency for the maternal mortality ratio.</p>
RATIONALE: >-
  <p>All maternal mortality indicators derived from the 2019 estimation round
  include a point-estimate and an 80% uncertainty interval (UI). Both
  point-estimates and 80% UIs should be taken into account when assessing
  estimates.</p>

  <p>For example: &#x201C;The estimated 2017 global MMR is 211 (UI 199 to
  243).&#x201D;</p>

  <p>This means:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>The point-estimate is 211 and the 80% uncertainty interval ranges 199 to 243.</li>
    <li>There is a 50% chance that the true 2017 global MMR lies above 211, and a 50% chance that the true value lies below 211.</li>
    <li>There is an 80% chance that the true 2017 global MMR lies between 199 and 243.</li>
    <li>There is still a 10% chance that the true 2017 global MMR lies above 243, and a 10% chance that the true value lies below 199.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Other accurate interpretations include:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>We are 90% certain that the true 2017 global MMR is at least 199.</li>
    <li>We are 90% certain that the true 2017 global MMR is 243 or less.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The amount of data available for estimating an indicator and the quality of
  that data determine the width of an indicator&#x2019;s UI. As data
  availability and quality improve, the certainty increases that an
  indicator&#x2019;s true value lies close to the point-estimate.</p>
REC_USE_LIM: >-
  <p>The extent of maternal mortality in a population is essentially the
  combination of two factors:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>The risk of death in a single pregnancy or a single live birth.</li>
    <li>The fertility level (i.e. the number of pregnancies or births that are experienced by women of reproductive age).</li>
  </ol>

  <p>The maternal mortality ratio (MMR) is defined as the number of maternal
  deaths during a given time period per 100 000 live births during the same time
  period. It depicts the risk of maternal death relative to the number of live
  births and essentially captures (i) above.</p>

  <p>By contrast, the maternal mortality rate (MMRate) is calculated as the
  number of maternal deaths divided by person-years lived by women of
  reproductive age. The MMRate captures both the risk of maternal death per
  pregnancy or per total birth (live birth or stillbirth), and the level of
  fertility in the population. </p>

  <p>In addition to the MMR and the MMRate, it is possible to calculate the
  adult lifetime risk of maternal mortality for women in the population. An
  alternative measure of maternal mortality, the proportion of deaths among
  women of reproductive age that are due to maternal causes (PM), is calculated
  as the number of maternal deaths divided by the total deaths among women aged
  15&#x2013;49 years.</p>
DATA_COMP: >-
  <p>The maternal mortality ratio can be calculated by dividing recorded (or
  estimated) maternal deaths by total recorded (or estimated) live births in the
  same period and multiplying by 100 000. Measurement requires information on
  pregnancy status, timing of death (during pregnancy, childbirth, or within 42
  days of termination of pregnancy), and cause of death.</p>

  <p>The maternal mortality ratio can be calculated directly from data collected
  through vital registration systems, household surveys or other sources. There
  are often data quality problems, particularly related to the underreporting
  and misclassification of maternal deaths. Therefore, data are often adjusted
  in order to take these data quality issues into account. Some countries
  undertake these adjustments or corrections as part of specialized/confidential
  enquiries or administrative efforts embedded within maternal mortality
  monitoring programmes.</p>

  <p><strong>Bayesian maternal mortality estimation model (the BMat
  model):</strong></p>

  <p>Estimation and projection of maternal mortality indicators are undertaken
  using the BMat model. This model is intended to ensure that the MMR estimation
  approach is consistent across all countries but remains flexible in that it is
  based on covariate-driven trends to inform estimates in countries or
  country-periods with limited information; captures observed trends in
  countries with longer time series of observations; and takes into account the
  differences in stochastic and sampling errors across observations.</p>

  <p>The model is summarized as follows:</p>

  <p><em>Estimation of HIV-related indirect maternal deaths:</em></p>

  <p>For countries with generalized HIV epidemics and high HIV prevalence,
  HIV/AIDS is a leading cause of death during pregnancy and post-delivery. There
  is also some evidence from community studies that women with HIV infection
  have a higher risk of maternal death, although this may be offset by lower
  fertility. If HIV is prevalent, there will also be more incidental HIV deaths
  among pregnant and postpartum women. When estimating maternal mortality in
  these countries, it is, thus, important to differentiate between incidental
  HIV deaths (non-maternal deaths) and HIV-related indirect maternal deaths
  (maternal deaths caused by the aggravating effects of pregnancy on HIV) among
  HIV-positive pregnant and postpartum women who have died (i.e. among all
  HIV-related deaths occurring during pregnancy, childbirth and puerperium).</p>

  <p><em>v = </em>is the proportion of HIV-related deaths to women aged

  computed as follows: <em>v </em>= <em>c k GFR / [</em>1 +
  <em>c</em>(<em>k-</em>1) <em>GFR] </em>where<strong> </strong>GFR is the
  general fertility rate, and where<em> c </em>is the average exposure time (in

  1 for this analysis), and where <em>k </em>is the relative risk of dying from
  AIDS for a pregnant versus a non-pregnant woman (reflecting both the decreased
  fertility of HIV-positive women and the increased mortality risk of
  HIV-positive pregnant women). The value of <em>k </em>was set at 0.3.</p>

  <p>u = is the fraction of pregnancy-related AIDS deaths assumed to be indirect
  maternal deaths. The UN MMEIG/TAG reviewed available study data on AIDS deaths
  among pregnant women and recommended using <em>u = </em>0.3.</p>

  <p>For observed PMs, we assumed that the total reported maternal deaths are a
  combination of the proportion of reported non-HIV-related maternal deaths and
  the proportion of reported HIV-related (indirect) maternal deaths, where the
  latter is given by a*v for observations with a &#x201C;pregnancy-related

DATA_VALIDATION: >-
  <p>Estimates are reviewed with Member States through a WHO country
  consultation process and SDG focal points. In 2001, the WHO Executive Board
  endorsed a resolution (EB. 107.R8) seeking to &#x201C;establish a technical
  consultation process bringing together personnel and perspectives from Member
  States in different WHO regions&#x201D;. A key objective of this consultation
  process is &#x201C;to ensure that each Member State is consulted on the best
  data to be used&#x201D;. Since the process is an integral step in the overall
  estimation strategy, it is described here in brief.</p>

  <p>The country consultation process entails an exchange between WHO and
  technical focal person(s) in each country. It is carried out prior to the
  publication of estimates. During the consultation period, WHO invites focal
  person(s) to review input data sources, methods for estimation and the
  preliminary estimates. Focal person(s) are encouraged to submit additional
  data that may not have been taken into account in the preliminary
  estimates.</p>

  <p> In brief:</p>

  <p>Adjustments for variation in definitions of the input data:</p>

  <p>Previous studies found incidental or accidental deaths (comprise 10% of
  pregnancy-related deaths (excluding HIV-related deaths) in sub-Saharan African
  countries, and 15% in other low- and middle-income countries. Adjustments are
  applied to pregnancy-related deaths to account for these non-maternal
  deaths.</p>

  <p>The proportion of pregnancy-related deaths among the deaths attributable to
  mortality shock from crisis is assumed to be equal to the proportion of women
  in the population who are pregnant or postpartum at the time of the crisis.
  The proportion of pregnant women in the population is set equal to the general
  fertility rate, based on the assumption of a one-year period associated with a
  live birth. Additional uncertainty is added to the estimates of crisis
  years.</p>

  <p>Adjustment for harmonization of breakdowns:</p>

  <p>Population-based surveys such as DHS and MICS obtain information by
  interviewing respondents about the survival of their siblings. This approach,
  commonly referred to as the direct sisterhood method. Given the study design
  (based on sisters of respondents), the population exposed to risk may be
  atypical of the population at large. Therefore, we compute an age-standardized
  value of PM, based on the female population of households at the time of the
  survey.</p>

  <p>Adjustment for underreporting (unregistered) and misclassification in CRVS
  systems:</p>

  <p>Underreporting and misclassification in CRVS systems are accounted for with
  specialized studies. Model estimated country-year specific adjustment factors
  are obtained and applied to CRVS data.</p>

  <p>Adjustment for under-reporting in non-CRVS and non-specialised sources:</p>

  <p>It is widely believed that some form of upward adjustment is required for
  population-based surveys to account for deaths early in pregnancy that might
  not have been captured. Therefore an upwards adjustment of 10% was applied to
  maternal deaths that were not obtained from CRVS systems or specialized
  studies.</p>
IMPUTATION: >-

    <li><strong>At country level</strong></li>
  </ul>

  <p>Missing values are treated at the country-level. This is done as follows.
  There is no treatment of missing values at the regional level.</p>

  <p><strong>Predictor variable data:</strong></p>

  <p>Complete and comparable predictor data is obtained by constructing time
  series estimates for predictor variables (covariates) from 1990 to 2019:</p>

  <ul>

  <p><strong>Disaggregation:</strong></p>

  <p>Current MMR estimates are reported at national, regional, and global
  levels. Countries and territories</p>

  <p>included in the analyses are WHO Member States with populations over 100
  000, plus two territories (Puerto Rico, and Occupied Palestinian Territory
  including east Jerusalem).</p>

  <p>The <strong>time series</strong> available is currently 2000 to 2017.</p>
COMPARABILITY: >-
  <p><strong>Sources of discrepancies:</strong></p>

  <p>The maternal mortality ratio is defined as the number of maternal deaths
  divided by live births. However, to account for potential incompleteness of
  death recording in various data sources, the MMEIG first computes the fraction
  of deaths due to maternal causes from original data sources (referred to as
  the &#x201C;proportion maternal&#x201D;, or PM), and then applies that
  fraction to WHO estimates of total deaths among women of reproductive age to
  obtain an estimate of the number of maternal deaths. </p>

  <p>In other words, the following fraction is first computed from country data
  sources:</p>

  <p>PM= Number of maternal deaths 15-49/All female deaths at ages 15-49 </p>

  <p>and then the PM is used to compute the MMR as follows:</p>

  <p>MMR=PM &#xD7; (All female deaths at ages 15-49/Number of live births)</p>

  <p>Where the estimate of all deaths at ages 15-49 in the second equation is
  derived from WHO Global Health Estimates life tables, and the number of live
  births is from the World Population Prospects 2019.</p>

  <p>With this as background, a few reasons that MMEIG estimates may differ from
  national statistics are as follows:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Civil registration and vital statistics systems are not always complete (i.e., they do not always capture 100% of all deaths) and completeness may change over time. The MMEIG estimation approach attempts to correct for this by using the above approach, which involves first computing the PM.</li>
    <li>The MMEIG often applies adjustment factors to the PM computed from original data to account for measurement issues (such as how the country defined &#x201C;maternal&#x201D; deaths; misclassification; or incompleteness). </li>
    <li>The MMEIG uses the standardized series of live births from the United Nations Population Division, as published in World Population Prospects 2019, in the denominator of the MMR equation. To better inform the WPP, countries should discuss discrepancies directly with the UNPD. The contact address is population@un.org; this email address is monitored regularly, and messages are dispatched to the appropriate analysts for each country or concern. </li>
    <li>Statistically speaking, maternal deaths are a relatively rare event, which can lead to noisy time trends in data over time. As the goal of the MMEIG estimates is to track long term progress in reducing maternal mortality, the estimation process involves some smoothing to generate a curve that better captures changes in underlying risk</li>
