  countries, small island developing States and African countries, for enrolment
  in higher education, including vocational training and information and
  communications technology, technical, engineering and scientific programmes,

  <p><strong>Definition:</strong></p>

  <p>Gross disbursements of total ODA from all donors for scholarships.</p>

  <p><strong>Concepts:</strong></p>

  <p>ODA: The DAC defines ODA as &#x201C;those flows to countries and
  territories on the DAC List of ODA Recipients and to multilateral institutions
  which are </p>

  <p>i) provided by official agencies, including state and local governments, or
  by their executive agencies; and </p>

  <p>ii) each transaction is administered with the promotion of the economic
  development and welfare of developing countries as its main objective; and</p>

  <p>is concessional in character and conveys a grant element of at least 25 per
  cent (calculated at a rate of discount of 10 per cent). (See
  http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/officialdevelopmentassistancedefinitionandcoverage.htm)</p>

  <p>Scholarships: Financial aid awards for individual students and
  contributions to trainees. The beneficiary students and trainees are nationals
  of developing countries. Financial aid awards include bilateral</p>

  <p>grants to students registered for systematic instruction in private or
  public institutions of higher education to follow full-time studies or
  training courses in the donor country. Estimated tuition costs</p>

  <p>of students attending schools financed by the donor but not receiving
  individual grants are not included here, but under item imputed student costs
  (CRS sector code 1520). Training costs relate to contributions</p>

  <p>for trainees from developing countries receiving mainly non-academic,
  practical or vocational training in the donor country.</p>
SOURCE_TYPE: >-
  <p>The OECD/DAC has been collecting data on official and private resource
  flows from 1960 at an aggregate level and 1973 at an activity level through
  the Creditor Reporting System (CRS data are considered complete from 1995 for
  commitments at an activity level and 2002 for disbursements). </p>

  <p>Data for scholarships are only available since 2010 when the new typology
  of aid was introduced in DAC statistics.</p>

  <p>The data are reported by donors according to the same standards and
  methodologies (see here: http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/methodology.htm). </p>

  <p>Data are reported on an annual calendar year basis by statistical reporters
  in national administrations (aid agencies, Ministries of Foreign Affairs or
  Finance, etc.</p>
COLL_METHOD: >-
  <p>A statistical reporter is responsible for the collection of DAC statistics
  in each providing country/agency. This reporter is usually located in the
  national aid agency, Ministry of Foreign Affairs or Finance etc. </p>
REL_CAL_POLICY: >-
  <p>Data are published on an annual basis in December for flows in the previous
  year.</p>

  <p>Detailed 2015 flows was published in December 2016.</p>

  level and 2002 for disbursements. </p>

  of aid was introduced in DAC statistics.</p>

  scholarships.</p>
IMPUTATION: >-
  <p><strong>&#x2022; At country level</strong></p>

  <p>Due to high quality of reporting, no estimates are produced for missing
  data.</p>

  <p><strong>&#x2022; At regional and global levels</strong></p>

  <p>Not applicable.</p>
REG_AGG: >-
  <p>Global and regional figures are based on the sum of ODA flows for

  <p><strong>Time series:</strong></p>

  <p>Data are available from 2010.</p>

  <p><strong>Disaggregation:</strong></p>

  <p>This indicator can be disaggregated by donor, recipient country, type of
  finance, etc.</p>
COMPARABILITY: >-
  <p><strong>Sources of discrepancies:</strong></p>
