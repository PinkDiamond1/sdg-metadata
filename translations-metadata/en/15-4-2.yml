  <p><strong>Definition:</strong></p>

  <p>The Mountain Green Cover Index (MGCI) is designed to measure the extent and
  the changes of green vegetation in mountain areas - i.e. forest, shrubs,
  trees, pasture land, cropland, etc. &#x2013; in order to monitor progress
  towards the mountain target. MGCI is defined as the percentage of green cover
  over the total surface of the mountain region of a given country and for given
  reporting year. The aim of the index is to monitor the evolution of the green
  cover and thus assess the status of conservation of mountain ecosystems.</p>

  <p><strong>Concepts:</strong></p>

  <p>The Mountain Green Cover index is based on two descriptor layers of
  information:</p>

  <p>1. <u>A mountain descriptor layer</u>: mountains can be defined with
  reference to a variety of parameters, such as climate, elevation, ecology
  (K&#xF6;rner <em>et al.</em>, 2011) (Karagulle <em>et al</em>., 2017). This
  methodology adheres to the UNEP- WCMC mountain definition, relying in turn on
  the mountain description proposed by Kapos <em>et al.</em> (2000).</p>

  <p>This description classifies mountains according altitude, slope and
  elevation range into 6 categories.</p>

  <p>2. <u>A vegetation descriptor layer</u>: The vegetation descriptor layer
  categorizes land cover into green and non-green areas. Green vegetation
  includes both natural vegetation and vegetation resulting from anthropic
  activity (e.g. crops, afforestation, etc.). Non-green areas include very
  sparsely vegetated areas, bare land, water, permanent ice/snow and urban
  areas. The vegetation description layer can be derived in different ways, but
  remote sensing based land cover maps are the most convenient data source for
  this purpose, as they provide the required information on green and non-green
  areas in a spatially explicit manner and allow for comparison over time
  through land cover change analysis. </p>

  <p>Currently, FAO uses land cover time series produced by the European Space
  Agency (ESA) under the Climate Change Initiative (CCI) as a general solution.
  The original CCI classes are re-classified into six IPCC classes and further
  into binary green/non-green cover classes as follows:</p>

  sources:</p>

  <ol>
    <li><strong> Vegetation descriptor layer: ESA CCI Land Cover data (ESA, 2017)</strong></li>
  </ol>

  <p>The European Space Agency Climate Change Initiative (ESA CCI) is a
  programme aiming at exploiting the full potential of the earth observation
  data collected by ESA to contribute to the Essential Climate Variables
  databases required by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate
  Change (UNFCCC). </p>

  <p>The CCI Land Cover products have been produced using a combination of
  remote sensing data such as the 300 m MERIS, 1km SPOT &#x2013;VEGETATION, 1km
  PROBA &#x2013;V and 1km AVHRR. The CCI product consists of a series of annual
  Land Cover maps at 300 m resolution spanning the period 1992 to 2018. The
  period from 1992-2015 is available in raster format, whereas the 2016-2018 is
  available in netCDF format and a transformation to GTIFF is required to make
  these datasets available for processing in a GIS environment. The land cover
  data is updated every year by the European Space Agency. </p>

  <p>The ESA CCI adheres to the Cover Classification System of the United
  Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (UN FAO) (Santoro <em>et al</em>.,
  2015). </p>

  <ol>
    <li><strong>Mountain descriptor layer:</strong></li>
  </ol>

  <p>The global mountain descriptor layer is based on the mountain
  classification proposed by Kapos <em>et al.</em> (2000):</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Class 1: elevation &gt; 4500 meters </li>
    <li>Class 2: elevation 3500 - 4500 meters</li>
    <li>Class 3: elevation 2500 &#x2013; 3500 meters </li>
    <li>Class 4: elevation 1500 &#x2013; 2500 meters and slope &#x2265; 2</li>
    <li>Class 5: elevation 1,000&#x2013;1,500 meters and slope &#x2265; 5 or local elevation range (7 kilometers radius) &#x2265; 300 meters</li>
    <li>Class 6: elevation 300&#x2013;1,000 meters and local elevation range (7 kilometres radius) &#x2265; 300 meters outside 23&#xB0;N&#x2014;19&#xB0;S </li>
    <li>Class 0: Defined to represent the non-mountainous areas. </li>
  </ul>

  <p>The mountain description layer used to derive the global estimates was
  created by the US Geological Survey from a 250 m DEM (Sayre <em>et al.</em>
  2018)</p>

  <p>These datasets may be replaced by nationally relevant data sources when

COLL_METHOD: >-
  <p>The indicator is generated for all countries and regions having mountain

  <p>Article 1 of FAO&#x2019;s constitution specifies that, &#x201C;The

  related to nutrition, food and agriculture.&#x201D; In this regard, FAO
  collects national level data from member countries, which it then standardizes
  and disseminates through corporate statistical databases. FAO is the custodian
  UN agency for 21 SDG indicators, including 15.4.2.</p>
RATIONALE: >-
  <p>Mountain ecosystems are important biodiversity centres that provide
  valuable ecosystem services to upstream and downstream areas. Yet, mountains
  are very fragile and impacted easily by both natural and anthropogenic
  factors. These can include climate change, natural hazards such as landslides
  and flooding, unplanned agricultural expansion, unplanned urbanization, timber
  extraction and recreational activities. The degradation of mountain ecosystems
  such as loss of the glacial cover, mountain biodiversity and green cover will
  affect the ability of the ecosystem to supply water downstream. The loss of
  forest and vegetative cover will reduce the ability of the ecosystem to retain
  soil and prevent landslides and flooding downstream. </p>

  <p>Therefore, monitoring mountain vegetation changes provides information on
  the status of mountain ecosystems. Monitoring the MGCI over time can provide
  information on the extent of vegetation change and of the general health of
  the mountain ecosystem. Assessing the change of green cover differentiated by
  elevation is important in understanding the changes that are occurring in the
  mountain regions due to the influence of slope, aspect and altitude of the
  mountain terrain to the ecosystem. </p>

  <p>However, the MGCI values should be interpreted with care. It does not
  provide the details on species change, change in the tree line or rain shadow
  areas. Understanding the variation in the species composition and the tree
  line will be important in identifying the long-term impacts of climate change
  in mountain regions. Analysing the vegetative variations in each of the
  elevation zones over time will assist in determining the appropriate
  management and adaption measures. </p>

  <p>In some cases, an increase in the indicator value in high elevation classes
  may also signify the encroachment of vegetation on areas previously covered by
  glaciers or other permanent or semi-permanent ice or snow layers, as a result
  of global warming due to climate change. Such a change can be tracked with the
  current methodology and flagged accordingly at the level of disaggregated data
  by land cover type and elevation class, to distinguish this case from the
  general desired trend of increasing mountain green cover.</p>
REC_USE_LIM: >-
  <p>The indicator can be calculated using freely available Earth Observation
  data and simple GIS operations that can be processed in free and open source
  software (FOSS) GIS. </p>

  <p>Potential limitations of the above describe methodology are related mainly
  to the quality of the land cover data. The ESA CCI land cover maps are
  currently available at 300 meter resolution which limits their applicability
  in the monitoring of small and highly heterogeneous landscapes. Therefore, if
  countries have national land cover maps of higher spatial resolution and
  comparable or better quality, FAO advises using them, following the same
  methodology presented here, for the generation of MGCI values. </p>

  <p>Regarding the interpretation of the indicator, although in the great
  majority of cases the desired direction is an increase in green mountain cover
  which reflects restriction of damage to natural ecosystems and possibly even
  the expansion of forest, shrubland and grasslands through conservation
  efforts, in more limited cases, an increase in the indicator value in high
  elevation classes may also signify the encroachment of vegetation on areas
  previously covered by glaciers or other permanent or semi-permanent ice or
  snow layers, as a result of global warming due to climate change. Such a
  change can be tracked with the current methodology and flagged accordingly at
  the level of disaggregated data by land cover type and elevation class, to
  distinguish this case from the general desired trend of increasing mountain
  green cover.</p>

COMPARABILITY: >-
  <p>Sources of discrepancies:</p>

  <p>The default methodology presented here is based on the use of the global
  ESA CCI Land Cover product, which has been reported to have an overall
  accuracy of 73.2%. However, the accuracy estimate was calculated using the
  original 22 land cover classes. As the methodology presented here is based on
  use of aggregate classes, the accuracy can be expected to be higher. </p>

  <p>The accuracy of the global land cover products can vary regionally. For the
  same reason, the presented indicator values may differ from those derived
  using national land cover maps. </p>
