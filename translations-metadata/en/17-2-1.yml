  <p>Target 17.2: Developed countries to implement fully their official
  development assistance commitments, including the commitment by many developed
  countries to achieve the target of 0.7 per cent of gross national income for
  official development assistance (ODA/GNI) to developing countries and 0.15 to
  0.20 per cent of ODA/GNI to least developed countries; ODA providers are
  encouraged to consider setting a target to provide at least 0.20 per cent of
  ODA/GNI to least developed countries</p>

  <p><strong>Definition:</strong></p>

  <p>The indicator Net official development assistance, total and to least
  developed countries, as a proportion of the Organization for Economic
  Cooperation and Development (OECD) Development Assistance Committee
  donors&apos; gross national income (GNI) is defined as Net ODA disbursements
  as a per cent of GNI.</p>

  <p><strong>Concepts:</strong></p>

  <p>ODA: The DAC defines ODA as &#x201C;those flows to countries and
  territories on the DAC List of ODA Recipients and to multilateral institutions
  which are i) provided by official agencies, including state and local
  governments, or by their executive agencies; and ii) each transaction is
  administered with the promotion of the economic development and welfare of
  developing countries as its main objective; and</p>

  <p>is concessional in character and conveys a grant element of at least 25 per
  cent (calculated at a rate of discount of 10 per cent). (See
  http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/officialdevelopmentassistancedefinitionandcoverage.htm)</p>

  <p>GNI is obtained by DAC reporters from their national statistical
  offices.</p>

  <p>Note: Since 2018, the Development Assistance Committee (DAC) of the OECD
  measures the headline ODA data as of 2018 on a grant equivalent basis. See
  references for more details.</p>
SOURCE_TYPE: >-
  <p>The OECD/DAC has been collecting data on official and private resource
  flows from 1960 at an aggregate level and 1973 at an activity level through
  the Creditor Reporting System (CRS data are considered complete from 1995 for
  commitments at an activity level and 2002 for disbursements).</p>

  <p>The data are reported by donors according to the same standards and
  methodologies (see here: http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/methodology.htm).</p>

  <p>Data are reported on an annual calendar year basis by statistical reporters
  in national administrations (aid agencies, Ministries of Foreign Affairs or
  Finance, etc.</p>
COLL_METHOD: >-
  <p>A statistical reporter is responsible for the collection of DAC statistics
  in each providing country/agency. This reporter is usually located in the
  national aid agency, Ministry of Foreign Affairs or Finance etc.</p>
FREQ_COLL: >-
  <p>Data are published on an annual basis in December for flows in the previous
  year. Detailed 2015 flows will be published in December 2016.</p>

  <p><strong>Disaggregation:</strong></p>

  <p>This indicator can be disaggregated by donor, recipient country, type of
