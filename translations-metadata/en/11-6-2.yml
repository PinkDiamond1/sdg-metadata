  <p>Goal 11: Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and

SDG_TARGET: >-
  <p>Target 11.6: By 2030, reduce the adverse per capita environmental impact of
  cities, including by paying special attention to air quality and municipal and
  other waste management</p>
SDG_INDICATOR: >-
  <p>Indicator 11.6.2: Annual mean levels of fine particulate matter (e.g. PM2.5
  and PM10) in cities (population weighted)</p>

  <p><strong>Definition:</strong></p>

  <p>The mean annual concentration of fine suspended particles of less than 2.5
  microns in diameters (PM2.5) is a common measure of air pollution. The mean is
  a population-weighted average for urban population in a country, and is
  expressed in micrograms per cubic meter [&#xF06D;g/m<sup>3</sup>].</p>
UNIT_MEASURE: '<p>Micrograms per cubic meter [&#xF06D;g/m<sup>3</sup></p>'
CLASS_SYSTEM: >-
  <p>The PM2.5 concentrations are geographically classified according to the
  2021 UNSD Degree of Urbanization classification: cities, towns and rural
  areas. Data is also provided for urban (aggregation of cities and towns) and
  all (aggregation of cities, towns and rural) areas.</p>
SOURCE_TYPE: >-
  <p>Sources of data include ground measurements from monitoring networks,
  collected for 6,000 cities and localities (WHO 2022) around the world,
  satellite remote sensing, population estimates, topography, information on
  local monitoring networks and measures of specific contributors of air
  pollution (WHO, 2022)</p>
COLL_METHOD: >-
  <p>Data collection process for ground measurements include official reporting
  from countries to WHO (after request), and web searches. Measurements of PM10
  or PM2.5 from official national/sub-national reports and websites or reported
  by regional networks such as Clean Air Asia for Asia and the European
  Environment Agency for Europe or data from UN agencies, development agencies,
  articles from peer reviewed journals and ground measurements compiled in the
  framework of the Global Burden of Disease Project.</p>
FREQ_COLL: <p>During 2020 to 2022</p>
REL_CAL_POLICY: <p>2022</p>

COMPILING_ORG: <p>WHO</p>
RATIONALE: >-
  <p>Air pollution consists of many pollutants, among other particulate matter.
  These particles are able to penetrate deeply into the respiratory tract and
  therefore constitute a risk for health by increasing mortality from
  respiratory infections and diseases, lung cancer, and selected cardiovascular
  diseases.</p>
REC_USE_LIM: >-
  <p>Urban/rural data: while the data quality available for urban/rural
  population is generally good for high-income countries, it can be relatively
  poor for some low- and middle income areas. Furthermore, the definition of
  urban/rural may greatly vary by country.</p>
DATA_COMP: >-
  <p>The annual urban mean concentration of PM2.5 is estimated with improved
  modelling using data integration from satellite remote sensing, population
  estimates, topography and ground measurements (WHO, 2016; Shaddick et al,
  2016)</p>

    <li><strong>At regional and global levels</strong></li>

  <p>Missing values are excluded from the regional and global averages.</p>
REG_AGG: >-
  <p>The regional and global aggregates are population -weighted figures of the
  national estimates. </p>

  <p>Cagg=SUM (Cnat * Pnat)/ SUM (Pnat)</p>

  <p>where Cagg is the regional/global estimate, Cnat is the national estimate,
  Pnat is the country population. The sum is done over the countries in the
  region (regional aggregate) or all countries (global aggregate).</p>
DOC_METHOD: >-
  <p>Countries which have air quality monitoring networks in places in urban
  areas can use the annual mean concentrations from the ground measurements and
  the corresponding number of inhabitants to derive the population-weighted
  exposure to particulate matter in cities.</p>
QUALITY_ASSURE: >-
  <p>Data inputs to the model are official or published data on air quality or
  other relevant topics. Modelled estimates are carefully crossed-checked and
  compared with official ground measurements.</p>

  <p>Consultation/validation process with countries for adjustments and
  estimates</p>

  <p>Data inputs, methods and final estimates are shared with countries prior to
  publication via WHO official communication channels with WHO Member
  States.</p>
COVERAGE: >-
  <p><strong>Data availability:</strong></p>

  <p>The indicator is available for 178 countries. Missing countries include
  mostly small states islands in the Western Pacific and in the Latin American
  and the Caribbean regions.</p>

  <p>Forthcoming</p>

  <p><strong>Disaggregation:</strong></p>

  <p>The indicator is available by 0.1&#xB0; x 0.1&#xB0; grid size for the
  world.</p>
COMPARABILITY: >-
  <p><strong>Sources of discrepancies:</strong></p>

  <p>The source of differences between global and national figures: Modelled
  estimates versus annual mean concentrations obtained from ground
  measurements.</p>
