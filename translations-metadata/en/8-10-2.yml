  <h2><strong><strong>Description:</strong></strong></h2>

  <p>The indicators in the 2014 Global Financial Inclusion (Global Findex)
  database are drawn from survey data covering almost 150,000 people in more
  than 140 economies&#x2014;representing more than 97 percent of the
  world&#x2019;s population. The survey was carried out over the 2014 calendar
  year by Gallup, Inc. as part of its Gallup World Poll, which since 2005 has
  continually conducted surveys of approximately 1,000 people in each of more
  than 160 economies and in over 140 languages, using randomly selected,
  nationally representative samples. The target population is the entire
  civilian, noninstitutionalized population age 15 and above. </p>

  <h2><strong><strong>Rationale:</strong></strong></h2>

  <p>Access to formal financial services such as savings, insurance, payments,
  credit and remittances is essential to the ability of people&#x2014;regardless
  of income level, gender, age, education or where they live&#x2014;to manage
  their lives, build their futures, and grow their businesses. Having access to
  an account is an important starting point for people to access arange of
  financial services.</p>

  <h2><strong><strong>Comments and limitations:</strong></strong></h2>

  <p>World Bank&#x2019;s Global Findex database is based on individual level
  surveys worldwide, conducted every three years. The first round of the survey
  was done in 2011, and the second in 2014. The third round will be done in
  2017. The database covers about 140 countries.</p>

  <h1>Methodology</h1>

  <h2><strong><strong>Computation method:</strong></strong></h2>

  <p>The indicator is based on data collected through individual level surveys
  in each country with representative samples. Appropriate sampling weights are
  used in calculating country-level aggregates.</p>

REG_AGG: >-
  <h2><strong><strong>Regional aggregates:</strong></strong></h2>

  <p>Country level; the percentage of adults owning accounts is multiplied by
  the number of adults in the country. Then for regional values, sum across all
  countries in the region is taken and divided by the total adults living in the
  region. Similarly, for global figures, the same calculation is repeated for
  all countries.</p>

  <p>Disaggregation by Income; Age; Education level; Urban/rural; Gender</p>
COMPARABILITY: >-
  <h2><strong><strong>Sources of discrepancies:</strong></strong></h2>

  <p>Global Findex is an individual level survey, measuring individual&#x2019;s
  ownership of accounts. As financial inclusion is an individual-level concept,
  this is the appropriate measure. Other surveys that are done at household
  level may measure the access to finance through another member of the
  household which may overestimate financial inclusion.</p>
