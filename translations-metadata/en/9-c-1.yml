  <p>Proportion of population covered by a mobile network, broken down by
  technology, refers to the percentage of inhabitants living within range of a
  mobile-cellular signal, irrespective of whether or not they are mobile phone
  subscribers or users. This is calculated by dividing the number of inhabitants
  within range of a mobile-cellular signal by the total population and
  multiplying by 100.</p>

  <p><strong>Concepts:</strong></p>

  <p>&quot;The indicator is based on where the population lives, and not where
  they work or go to school, etc. When there are multiple operators offering the
  service, the maximum population number covered should be reported. Coverage
  should refer to LTE, broadband (3G) and narrowband (2G) mobile-cellular
  technologies and include:</p>

  <p>- 2G mobile population coverage: Mobile networks with access to data
  communications (e.g. Internet) at downstream speeds below 256 Kbit/s. This
  includes mobile-cellular technologies such as GPRS, CDMA2000 1x and most EDGE
  implementations. The indicator refers to the theoretical ability of
  subscribers to use non-broadband speed mobile data services, rather than the
  number of active users of such services.</p>

  <p>- 3G population coverage: refers to the percentage of inhabitants that are
  within range of at least a 3G mobile-cellular signal, irrespective of whether
  or not they are subscribers. This is calculated by dividing the number of
  inhabitants that are covered by at least a 3G mobile-cellular signal by the
  total population and multiplying by 100. It excludes people covered only by
  GPRS, EDGE or CDMA 1xRTT.</p>

  <p>- LTE population coverage: Refers to the percentage of inhabitants that
  live within range of LTE/LTE-Advanced, mobile WiMAX/WirelessMAN or other more
  advanced mobile-cellular networks, irrespective of whether or not they are
  subscribers. This is calculated by dividing the number of inhabitants that are
  covered by the previously mentioned mobile-cellular technologies by the total
  population and multiplying by 100. It excludes people covered only by HSPA,
  UMTS, EV-DO and previous 3G technologies, and also excludes fixed WiMAX
  coverage.</p>

  <p>As technologies evolve and as more and more countries will deploy and
  commercialize more advanced mobile-broadband networks (5G etc.), the indicator
  will include further breakdowns.&quot;</p>

  its Expert Groups and following an extensive consultation process with

  Development&apos;s Core List of Indicators, which has been endorsed by the UN
  Statistical Commission (last time in 2014).</p>

  <p>ITU collects data for this indicator through an annual questionnaire from

  <p>As the UN specialized agency for ICTs, ITU is the official source for
  global ICT statistics, collecting ICT data from its Member States. </p>
RATIONALE: >-
  <p>The percentage of the population covered by a mobile cellular network can
  be considered as a minimum indicator for ICT access since it provides people
  with the possibility to subscribe to and use mobile-cellular services to
  communicate. Over the last decade, mobile-cellular networks have expanded
  rapidly and helped overcome very basic infrastructure barriers that existed
  when fixed-telephone networks &#x2013; often limited to urban and highly
  populated areas - were the dominant telecommunication infrastructure.</p>

  <p>While 2G (narrowband) mobile-cellular networks offer limited (and mainly
  voice-based) services, higher-speed networks (3G and LTE) provide increasingly
  high-speed, reliable and high-quality access to the Internet and its
  increasing amount of information, content, services, and applications. Mobile
  networks are therefore essential to overcoming infrastructure barriers,
  helping people join the information society and benefit from the potential of
  ICTs, in particular in least developed countries.</p>

  <p>The indicator highlights the importance of mobile networks in providing
  basic, as well as advanced communication services and will help design
  targeted policies to overcome remaining infrastructure barriers, and address
  the digital divide. Many governments track this indicator and have set
  specific targets in terms of the mobile population coverage (by technology)
  that operators must achieve.</p>
REC_USE_LIM: >-
  <p>Some countries have difficulty calculating overall mobile-cellular
  population coverage. In some cases, data refer only to the operator with the
  largest coverage, and this may understate the true coverage.</p>
DATA_COMP: >-
  <p>The indicator percentage of the population covered by a mobile network,
  broken down by technology, refers to the percentage of inhabitants living
  within range of a mobile-cellular signal, irrespective of whether or not they
  are mobile phone subscribers or users. This is calculated by dividing the
  number of inhabitants within range of a mobile-cellular signal by the total
  population and multiplying by 100.</p>

IMPUTATION: >-
  <p><strong>&#x2022; At country level</strong></p>

  <p>Missing values are estimated using data published by mobile cellular
  operators that have the largest market share.</p>

  <p><strong>&#x2022; At regional and global levels</strong></p>

  <p>Missing values are estimated using data published by mobile cellular
  operators that have the largest market share.</p>
REG_AGG: >-
  <p>Global and regional estimates are produced using weighted country-level
  data. First, the missing country-level data are estimated using data of the
  dominant mobile operator. Once all the country-level percentages are
  available, the number of people covered by the mobile signal is calculated by
  multiplying the percentage of population covered by the signal to the
  population of the country. The regional and world total population covered by
  a signal were calculated by summing the country-level data. The aggregate
  percentages were calculated by dividing the regional totals by the population
  of respective groups.</p>

  can produce estimates on rural and urban population coverage. ITU produces
  global estimates for the rural population coverage, by technology.</p>

  <p>None. ITU uses the data provided by countries, including the in-scope
  population that is used to calculate the percentages.</p>
