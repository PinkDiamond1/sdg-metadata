  <p><strong>Definition:</strong></p>

  <p>Total resource flows for development, by recipient and donor countries and
  type of flow comprises of Official Development Assistance (ODA), other
  official flows (OOF) and private flows.</p>

  <p><strong>Concepts:</strong></p>

  <p>Official and private flows, both concessional and non-concessional to
  developing countries. For official flows the major distinction is between
  official development assistance (ODA) and other official flows</p>

  <p>OOF, while private flows are broken down into flows at market terms and
  charitable grants. Flows include contributions to multilateral development
  agencies, which are themselves official bodies.</p>

  <p>The data are reported by donors according to the same standards and
  methodologies (see here: http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/methodology.htm).</p>

  <p>Data are reported on an annual calendar year basis by statistical reporters
  in national administrations (aid agencies, Ministries of Foreign Affairs or

COLL_METHOD: >-
  <p>A statistical reporter is responsible for the collection of DAC statistics
  in each providing country/agency. This reporter is usually located in the
  national aid agency, Ministry of Foreign Affairs or Finance etc.</p>
FREQ_COLL: >-
  <p>Data are published on an annual basis in December for flows in the previous

  (bilateral and multilateral) that report to the DAC.</p>

  <p>On a recipient basis for all developing countries eligible for ODA.</p>

  <p><strong>Disaggregation:</strong></p>

  <p>This indicator can be disaggregated by type of flow (ODA, OOF, private), by
