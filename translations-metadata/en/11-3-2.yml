  <p><strong>Definition:</strong></p>

  <p>Civil society organizations (CSOs) make a difference in international
  development. They provide development services and humanitarian relief,
  innovate in service delivery, build local capacity and advocate with and for
  the poor. Acting alone, however, their impact is limited in scope, scale and
  sustainability. CSOs need to engage in government policy processes more
  effectively. The development of sustainable human settlements calls for the
  active engagement of all key stakeholders with particular attention to
  project/programme beneficiaries and vulnerable groups. Therefore local and
  national governments should strive to: a) facilitate and protect
  people&#x2019;s participation and civic engagement through independent civil
  society organizations that can be from diverse backgrounds - local, national,
  and international; b) promote civic and human rights education and training
  programmes to make urban residents aware of their rights and the changing
  roles of diverse women, men, and young women and men in urban settings; c)
  remove the barriers that block participation of socially marginalized groups
  and promote non-discrimination and the full and equal participation of women,
  young men and women and marginalized groups. To monitor this indicator fully,
  it is important to define cities as unique entities and define what
  constitutes direct participation structures of civil society. Urban planning
  and management are more clear concepts that UN-Habitat has worked on
  developing for the last few decades and these are well articulated in the
  urban agenda documents. Experts who have worked on the methodological
  developments of this indicator have there put forth the below definitions to
  help guide the work on this indicator.</p>

  <p><strong>Concepts:</strong></p>

  <p>Many urban related SDGs require global monitoring with the
  &#x2018;city&#x2019; as the unit of analysis. In order to monitor the urban
  SDGs in particular, it is necessary to agree on a global/common definition of
  what constitutes a &#x2018;city&#x2019;. A standard city definition will
  assist in the monitoring of the SDGs by ensuring that the study areas for the
  spatial urban SDGs are standardized and easily reproducible, and will add
  clarity to the methodologies and approaches to the collection of data to
  support the land and rural related indicators. UN-Habitat in collaboration
  with New York University and European Commission&#x2019;s Joint Research
  Centre has adopted two definitions of cities. </p>

  <ol>
    <li>City as defined by its Urban extent (built-up and urbanized open space) - New York University</li>
  </ol>

  <p>Urban extent is defined as the total area occupied by the built-up area and
  the urbanized open space. The built-up area is defined as the contiguous area
  occupied by buildings and other impervious surfaces, but excluding urbanized
  open space, both public and private, as well as vacant lands.</p>

  <p>Landsat imagery<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2"
  id="footnote-ref-2">[1]</a></sup></sup> is used to identify and classify the
  built-up pixels into 3 types depending on the share of built-up density
  (urbanness) in a 1-km2 circle of a given building:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Urban built-up area: built-up pixels where the walking distance circle has a built-up density greater than 50%. </li>
    <li>Suburban built-up area: built-up pixels where the walking distance circle has a built-up density between 25%-50%. It also includes subdivided land, whether it is wholly unbuilt or not.</li>
    <li>Rural built-up area: built-up pixels where walking distance circle has a built-up density of less than 25% and that are not on subdivided land. </li>
    <li>The urbanized open space (mainly refers to unbuilt areas including open countryside, forests, crop fields, parks, unbuilt urban areas, cleared land) is classified into 3 types:</li>
    <li>Fringe open space consists of all open space pixels within 100 meters of urban or suburban pixels;</li>
    <li>Captured open space consists of all open space clusters that are fully surrounded by urban and suburban built-up pixels and the fringe open space pixels around them, and that are less than 200 hectares in area; and</li>
    <li>Rural open space consists of all open spaces that are not fringe or captured open spaces.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The fringe open space and captured open space together, make up the
  urbanized open space in a given study area. In other words, the urban extent
  consists of all the buildings and the small open space areas (&lt;200 ha) that
  are surrounded by buildings and the open space fringe that is within 100
  meters of urban and suburban areas.</p>

  <ol>
    <li>City as defined by its Degree of Urbanisation (DEGURBA) - European Commission</li>
  </ol>

  <p>The Degree of urbanisation (DEGURBA) is a classification that indicates the
  character of an area. Based on the share of the local population living in 3
  different types of clusters, local administrative units (LAUs) are classified
  into three types of area: thinly populated area (rural area); intermediate
  density area (towns and suburbs/small urban area), and densely populated area
  (cities/large urban area) following a 2-step procedure. </p>

  <p>In a first step, grid cells of 1 km2 are classified into one of the three
  following clusters, according to their population size and density:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>High-density cluster/urban centre: contiguous grid cells of 1 km2 with a density of at least 1 500 inhabitants per km2 and a minimum population of 50 000;</li>
    <li>Urban cluster: cluster of contiguous grid cells of 1 km2 with a density of at least 300 inhabitants per km2 and a minimum population of 5 000;</li>
    <li>Rural grid cell: grid cell outside high-density clusters and urban clusters.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>In a second step, local administrative units are then classified into one
  of three types of areas:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Densely populated area (alternative names: cities or large urban area): at least 50 % live in high-density clusters; in addition, each high-density cluster should have at least 75 % of its population in densely-populated LAUs; this also ensures that all high-density clusters are represented by at least one densely-populated LAU, even when this cluster represents less than 50 % of the population of that LAU;</li>
    <li>Intermediate density area (alternative name: towns and suburbs or small urban area): less than 50 % of the population lives in rural grid cells and less than 50 % live in high-density clusters;Thinly populated area (alternative name: rural area): more than 50 % of the population lives in rural grid cells.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Other concepts</strong></p>

  <p>Democratic participation: Structures allow and encourage participation of
  civil society representing a cross-section of society that allows for equal
  representation of all members of the community with equal rights for
  participation and voting. </p>

  <p>Direct participation: Structures allow and encourage civil society
  accessing and actively engaging in decision-making, without intermediaries, at
  every stage of the urban planning and management process.</p>

  <p>Regular participation: Structures allow and encourage civil society
  participation in urban planning and management processes at every stage, and
  at least every six months.</p>

  <p>Marginalized groups: Groups of people that are not traditionally given
  equal voice in governance processes. These include, but are not limited to,
  women, young men and women, low-income communities, ethnic minorities,
  religious minorities, people with disabilities, the elderly, and sexual and
  gender identity minorities and migrants.</p>

  <p>Structures: Any formal structure that allows for participation of civil
  society. This can include, but is not limited to national or local
  legislation, policy, town council meetings, websites, elections, suggestion
  boxes, appeals processes, notice period for planning proposals etc. </p>

  <p>Civil Society: The combination of non-governmental organizations, community
  groups, community-based organizations, regional representative groups, unions,
  research institutes, think tanks, professional bodies, non-profit sports and
  cultural groups, and any other groups that represent the interests and wills
  of the members and wider community. </p>

  <p>Urban Management: The officials, including elected officials and public
  servants, that are responsible for city-management, across all sectors, such
  as roads, water, sanitation, energy, public space, land title etc.</p>

  <p>Urban Budget decision making: The process by which money is allocated to
  various sectors of urban management, including roads, roads, water,
  sanitation, energy, public space, land title etc.</p>

  <p>Urban Planning, including Design and Agreements: The technical and
  political process that concerns the development and use of land, how the
  natural environment is used etc. Design includes over-arching and specific
  design of public space, as well as zoning and land use definitions. Agreements
  refer to specific contract/arrangements made with various groups in regard to
  their land, e.g. Indigenous groups, protected natural environments
  etc.</p><div class="footnotes"><div><sup class="footnote-number"
  id="footnote-2">1</sup><p> Landsat Imagery is made up of several spectral

FREQ_COLL: >-

DATA_SOURCE: <p>National statistical organisations.</p>
COMPILING_ORG: >-
  <p>UN-Habitat</p>

  <p>UN-Habitat and other partners are supporting various components (systems,
  tools development and capacity strengthening, etc) for reporting on this
  indicator.</p>
RATIONALE: >-
  <p>This indicator measures the progress and willingness of elected officials,
  urban managers and planners to integrate resident and civil society
  participation in urban planning and management at various levels. Local
  authorities and governments, along with the international community, are
  increasingly recognizing the value of civil society and residents&#x2019;
  participation in strengthening the urban development processes. This
  people-centered approach is key in guiding urban development processes for
  local ownership, and the implementation of community projects at citywide or
  local levels.</p>

  <p>Civil society and public participation fosters a positive relationship
  between government and the public by communicating effectively and solving the
  conflicts in a cooperative manner. In many cases when urban planning decisions
  are made without consultation, the desired results are not achieved and there
  is a negative impact on society, due to inefficient allocation and use of
  resources. Ensuring that wide varieties of opinions are considered assists the
  decision makers with understanding the interlinkages and nature of problems
  and potential solutions facing different urban settings. </p>

  <p>Urban development is a reflection of ideology and national institutions.
  Public participation means a broader consensus is built and this greatly
  enhances political interaction between citizens and government, and enhances
  the legitimacy of the planning process and the plan itself. A plan is more
  effective if a broad coalition supports the proposal and works together to
  deliver it. </p>

  <p>Civil society and public participation in urban management and governance
  also shows respect to participants&#x2019; opinion, needs, aspirations and
  assets. It can boost their enthusiasm for citizenship and politics, and
  strengthens their influence in urban planning and public life. When
  conflicting claims and views are considered, there is a much higher
  possibility that public trust and buy-in increases in the outcome. This has
  broader implications for building an active, inclusive and equitable society
  and more inclusive and sustainable urban environments.</p>
REC_USE_LIM: >-
  <p>The indicator measures the availability of structures for civil society
  participation in urban planning and management, which is a reflection of
  structures for citizen voices/participation. The fact that informed evaluators
  conduct the evaluation can introduce biases. These biases and discrepancies
  have been examined in the pilot phases and so far the experiences is that the
  marginal differences are not as large as we were expecting. Overall, the
  evaluators&#x2019; assessments sometimes do not reflect a full analysis of the
  effectiveness or accessibility of these structures in its totality, but gives
  a local idea of how these evaluators view the inclusiveness and openness on
  these structures to accommodate the participation of citizens and civil
  society. Changes in data will be examined for intra-city differences and
  within country differences over time to understand more sources for variations
  and internal consistencies. </p>

  <p>Within the civic society landscape, there are many types of players
  including civil societies led by individuals, community groups, advocates,
  corporations and foundations. Similarly, there are many different views about
  the relevance and importance of civil society participation particularly,
  perhaps, among different groups as listed above and for these different
  structures at the urban level maybe available for involvement or not. </p>

  <p>Finally, civic society engagement in urban planning and management involves
  overlapping pathways, and goals as well as a mix of planned and unpredicted
  elements. Advancing toward a measurement frame is intended to help sort out
  theories and pathways &#x2013; not to set hard boundary lines, but rather to
  help both urban managers and communities better understand what they are
  trying to achieve, and how they are getting there.</p>
DATA_COMP: >-
  <p>To measure existence of direct participation structures of civil society in
  urban planning and management at the city level, a scorecard approach will be
  used to evaluate the available structures for civil society participation in
  urban planning and management, as evaluated by five (5) local experts from
  government, academia, civil society and international organizations. The
  identifications and selection of these 5 local evaluators/experts will be
  guided by local urban observatories teams that are available in many cities.
  In the pilot exercises, these urban observatories as local custodians of urban
  data at the city level are able to coordinate the assessments, and check for
  consistencies and relevant local references that guide the decisions and
  scores of the evaluators.</p>

  <p>A questionnaire with a 4-point Likert scale (strongly disagree, disagree,
  agree, and strongly agree) will be used to measure and test the existence of
  structures for civil society participation in urban governance and management.
  As experts, we agreed that these structures are examined through four core
  elements and these were assessed in the completed pilot exercises as
  follows:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Are there structures for civil society participation in urban planning, including design and agreements, that are direct, regular and democratic?</li>
    <li>Are there structures for civil society participation in local urban budget decision-making, that are direct, regular and democratic?</li>
    <li>Are there structures for civil society evaluation and feedback on the performance of urban management, that are direct, regular and democratic?</li>
    <li>Do these structures promote the participation of women, young men and women, and/or other marginalized groups?</li>
  </ol>

  <p>The evaluators score each of the questions on the Likert Scale, as below:
  </p>

  <p>1 - Strongly disagree, 2 - Disagree, 3 - Agree, 4 - Strongly agree</p>

  <p>The Likert Scale use the following guidance for grading: </p>

  <p>Strongly Disagree: There are no structures in place or available structures
  do not allow civil society participation that is direct, regular or
  democratic.</p>

  <p>Disagree: Structures exist that allow civil society participation, but they
  are only partially direct, regular and democratic; or they are only one of
  direct, regular or democratic.</p>

  <p>Agree: Structures exist that allow and encourage civil society
  participation that is direct and/or regular and/or democratic, but not all
  three. </p>

  <p>Strongly Agree: Structures exist that allow and encourage civil society
  participation that is fully direct, regular and democratic.</p>

  <p>Once each of the five (5) categories is evaluated as shown in the table
  above by a single evaluator, the total average score of the single evaluator
  is computed. The various scores of the evaluators are then averaged to compute
  the final score for every city.</p>

  <p>To determine the proportion of cities with a direct participation structure
  of civil society in urban planning and management that operates regularly and
  democratically, a midpoint on the Likert scale of 2.5 will be used. The value
  of the indicator is the proportion of cities with overall score that is
  greater than the mid-point. </p>

  <p>As a result, if we have N cities selected for the evaluation in a given
  country, and n is the number of cities with scores that are higher than the
  mid-point, the value of the indicator will be calculated as:</p>
