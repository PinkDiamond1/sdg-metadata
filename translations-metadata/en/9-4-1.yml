  <p>Definitions:</p>

  <p>Carbon dioxide (here after, CO<sub>2</sub>) emissions per unit of value
  added is an indicator computed as ratio between CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from
  fuel combustion and the value added of associated economic activities. The
  indicator can be computed for the whole economy (total CO<sub>2</sub>
  emissions/GDP) or for specific sectors, notably the manufacturing sector
  (CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from manufacturing industries per manufacturing
  value added (MVA). </p>

  <p>CO<sub>2</sub> emissions per unit of GDP are expressed in kilogrammes of
  CO<sub>2</sub> per unit of purchasing power parity GDP in constant 2017 USD.
  CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from manufacturing industries per unit of MVA are
  measured in kilogrammes of CO<sub>2</sub> equivalent per unit of MVA in
  constant 2015 USD.</p>

  <p>Concepts:</p>

  <p>Total CO<sub>2</sub> emissions for an economy are estimated based on energy
  consumption data for all sectors.</p>

  <p>CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from manufacturing are based on energy data
  collected across the following subsectors (energy used for transport by
  industry is not included here but reported under transport):</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Iron and steel industry [ISIC Group 241 and Class 2431];</li>
    <li>Chemical and petrochemical industry [ISIC Divisions 20 and 21] excluding petrochemical feedstocks;</li>
    <li>Non-ferrous metals basic industries [ISIC Group 242 and Class 2432];</li>
    <li>Non-metallic minerals such as glass, ceramic, cement, etc. [ISIC Division 23];</li>
    <li>Transport equipment [ISIC Divisions 29 and 30];</li>
    <li>Machinery comprises fabricated metal products, machinery and equipment other than transport equipment [ISIC Divisions 25 to 28];</li>
    <li>Food and tobacco [ISIC Divisions 10 to 12];</li>
    <li>Paper, pulp and printing [ISIC Divisions 17 and 18];</li>
    <li>Wood and wood products (other than pulp and paper) [ISIC Division 16];</li>
    <li>Textile and leather [ISIC Divisions 13 to 15];</li>
    <li>Non-specified (any manufacturing industry not included above) [ISIC Divisions 22, 31 and 32].</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Energy data are collected at a country level, based on internationally
  agreed standards (UN International Recommendations on Energy Statistics
  (IRES)). CO<sub>2</sub> emissions need to be estimated based on energy data
  and on internationally agreed methodologies (2006 IPCC Guidelines for National
  GHG Inventories). </p>

  <p>The IEA collects national energy data, according to internationally agreed
  energy statistics definitions and estimates CO<sub>2</sub> emissions based on
  the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National GHG Inventories&#x2019; Tier 1
  methodology, producing internationally comparable CO<sub>2</sub> emissions
  data for over 150 countries and regions.</p>

  <p>The gross value added measures the contribution to the economy of each
  individual producer, industry or sector in a country. The gross value added
  generated by any unit engaged in production activity can be calculated as the
  residual of the units&#x2019; total output less intermediate consumption,
  goods and services used up in the process of producing the output, or as the
  sum of the factor incomes generated by the production process (System of
  National Accounts 2008). Manufacturing refers to industries belonging to the
  sector C defined by International Standard Industrial Classification of All
  Economic Activities (ISIC) Revision 4, or D defined by ISIC Revision 3.</p>

  <p>GDP represents the sum of gross value added from all institutional units
  resident in the economy. For the purpose on comparability over time and across
  countries, GDP based on purchasing power parity (PPP) is used to calculate the
  total CO<sub>2</sub> emissions intensity of the economy. MVA is estimated in
  terms of constant prices in USD. The current series are given at constant
  prices of 2015.</p>
UNIT_MEASURE: >-
  <p>CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from fuel combustion are reported in millions of
  tonnes. </p>

  <p>CO<sub>2</sub> emissions per unit of GDP PPP are reported in kilogrammes of
  CO<sub>2</sub> per constant 2017 United States dollars. </p>

  <p>CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from manufacturing industries per unit of MVA are
  reported in kilogrammes of CO<sub>2</sub> per constant 2015 United States
  dollars.</p>

  <p>The IEA produces the indicator on total CO<sub>2</sub> emissions/GDP, based
  on secondary sources for GDP (World Bank Development indicators and the
  National Accounts &#x2013; Analysis of Main Aggregates (AMA)).</p>

  <p>UNIDO maintains the MVA database. Figures for updates are obtained from
  national account estimates produced by UN Statistics Division (UNSD) and from
  national publications.</p>
COLL_METHOD: >-
  <p>The IEA collects energy data at the national level according to harmonised
  international definitions and questionnaires, as described in the UN
  International Recommendations for Energy Statistics available at : (<a

  href="http://wds.iea.org/wds/pdf/Worldco2_Documentation.pdf">wds.iea.org/wds/pdf/Worldco2_Documentation.pdf</a></p>

  <p>The most recent GDP estimates published by the World Bank with reference
  year of 2017 have been used when calculating CO<sub>2</sub> emissions per unit
  of GDP indicator. Additionally, missing years for countries with at least one
  data point for GDP reported by the World Bank have been estimated using
  National Accounts &#x2013; Analysis of Main Aggregates (AMA) growth rates.</p>

  <p>For the calculation of the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from manufacturing
  industries per unit of MVA indicator, the MVA and GDP country data are
  collected through a national accounts questionnaire (NAQ) sent by UNSD. More
  information on the methodology is available at:</p>

  <p><strong>Name:</strong></p>

  <p>UNIDO, IEA</p>

  <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>

  <p>IEA provides data on total CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, CO<sub>2</sub>
  emissions/GDP PPP and manufacturing CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.</p>

  <p>UNIDO compiles the data using its source for MVA data and IEA for data on
  CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.</p>
INST_MANDATE: >-
  <p>IEA as one of the custodian agencies responsible for monitoring progress
  towards the SDG 7.3 target, leverage on their national data efforts and add
  value by promoting coherent standards, definitions and methodologies for both
  raw data and the derived indicators with the ultimate goal of producing
  international comparable datasets. </p>

  <p>UNIDO, as the specialized UN agency on industrial development, has the
  international mandate for collecting, producing and disseminating
  internationally comparable industrial statistics. UNIDO&#x2019;s mandate
  covers (i) the maintenance and updating of international industrial statistics
  databases; (ii) methodological and analytical products based on statistical
  research and experience of maintaining internationally comparable statistics;
  (iii) contributions to the development and implementation of international
  statistical standards and methodology; and (iv) technical cooperation services
  to countries in the field of industrial statistics. With the repositioning of
  UNIDO as the focal agency for inclusive and sustainable industrial development
  (ISID), its statistical mandate was expanded to cover all dimensions of
  industrial development, including its inclusiveness and environmental
  sustainability.</p>
RATIONALE: >-
  <p>The indicator CO<sub>2</sub> emissions per unit of value added represents
  the amount of emissions from fuel combustion produced by an economic activity,
  per unit of economic output. When computed for the whole economy, it combines
  effects of the average carbon intensity of the energy mix (linked to the
  shares of the various fossil fuels in the total); of the structure of an
  economy (linked to the relative weight of more or less energy-intensive
  sectors); of the average efficiency in the use of energy. When computed for
  the manufacturing sector (CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from fuel combustion per
  unit of manufacturing value added), it measures the carbon intensity of the
  manufacturing economic output, and its trends result from changes in the
  average carbon intensity of the energy mix used, the structure of the
  manufacturing sector, the energy efficiency of production technologies in each
  sub-sector and the economic value of the various output. Manufacturing
  industries are generally improving their emission intensity as countries move
  to higher levels of industrialization, but it should be noted that emission
  intensities can also be reduced through structural changes and product
  diversification in manufacturing. </p>

  <p>CO<sub>2</sub> emission accounts for around 80% of all GHG emission from
  the manufacturing processes. </p>
REC_USE_LIM: >-
  <p>Estimation of CO<sub>2</sub> emission data is not systematized in many
  countries, although is performed internationally based on harmonised energy
  data collected at national level. Energy data collection is generally well
  established, although in some cases national methodologies may differ from
  internationally agreed methodologies. National data sources include
  statistical offices, energy ministries, environment agencies, among others.
  Energy consumption data and value added data are coming from different data
  sources which may raise some consistency issues.</p>
DATA_COMP: >-
  <p>CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from fuel combustion are estimated based on energy
  consumption and on the 2006 IPCC Guidelines on National GHG Inventories.</p>

  <p>The total intensity of the economy is defined as the ratio of total
  CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from fuel combustion and per unit of GDP. For
  international comparison purposes, GDP is measured in constant terms at
  purchasing power parity and the indicator is expressed in kilogrammes of CO2
  per constant 2017 USD PPP for the current series.</p>

  <p>The sectoral intensity is defined as CO<sub>2</sub> emission from
  manufacturing (in physical measurement unit such as tonnes) divided by
  manufacturing value added (MVA) in constant 2015 USD.</p>

DATA_VALIDATION: >-
  <p>The IEA has several internal procedures in place for energy data
  validation. This includes energy balance checks, time series analysis and
  reconciling differences in statistical classifications and definitions.</p>

  <p>UNIDO engages with countries in regular consultations during the data
  collection process to ensure the data quality and international
  comparability.</p>
ADJUSTMENT: >-
  <p>The country specific commodity balances underlying the IEA CO<sub>2</sub>
  emissions estimates are based on national energy data of heterogeneous nature
  converted and adapted to fit the IEA format and methodology. Considerable
  effort has been made to ensure that the data adhere to the IEA definitions
  based on the guidelines provided by IRES. Nevertheless, energy statistics at
  the national level are often collected using criteria and definitions which
  differ, sometimes considerably, from those of international organisations.
  This is especially true for non-OECD countries, which are submitting data to
  the IEA on a voluntary basis. The IEA has identified most of these differences
  and, where possible, adjusted the data to meet international definitions. For
  details on recognized country specific anomalies and the corresponding
  adjustments, please refer to country specific notes included in the IEA World
  energy balances documentation file available at: <a
  href="http://wds.iea.org/wds/pdf/WORLDBAL_Documentation.pdf">wds.iea.org/wds/pdf/WORLDBAL_Documentation.pdf</a></p>

  <p>UNIDO compiles the MVA data based on the UNSD National Accounts Main
  Aggregates Database (NAMAD) and national publications. UNSD collects national
  accounts data through a regular consultation with countries and areas by
  sending the UN NAQ to obtain important information about differences in
  concept, scope, coverage and classification used. The final estimates are
  provided to facilitate international comparability. More detailed information
  on estimation methods is available here: <a
  href="https://unstats.un.org/unsd/snaama/assets/pdf/methodology.pdf">https://unstats.un.org/unsd/snaama/assets/pdf/methodology.pdf</a></p>

  <p>The MVA data are nowcasted by UNIDO to enhance a timely analysis of
  manufacturing trends.</p>
IMPUTATION: >-
  <p>&#x2022; At country level</p>

  <p>Providing all the elements of energy balance, underlying the IEA CO<sub>2
  </sub>emissions estimations has often required estimations. Estimations have
  been generally made after consultation with national statistical offices,
  energy companies, utilities and national energy experts.</p>

  <p>Boudt, Todorov, Upadhyaya (2009): Nowcasting manufacturing value added for
  cross-country comparison; Statistical Journal of IAOS</p>

  <p>&#x2022; At regional and global levels</p>

  <p>In the compilation of the IEA energy balances which are the underlying for
  estimating the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and in addition to estimates at a
  country level, adjustments addressing differences in definitions alongside
  estimations for informal and/or confidential trade, production or stock
  changes of energy products are sometimes required to complete major
  aggregates, when key statistics are missing. Such estimations and adjustments
  implemented by IEA have been generally made after consultation with national
  statistical offices, energy companies, utilities and national energy
  experts.</p>

  <p>No imputation is provided if values are missing for the entire country or
  the region. It can only be projected from the data reported for previous
  years.</p>
REG_AGG: >-
  <p>Regional aggregates are calculated by summing both the numerator and
  denominator over the group of relevant countries.</p>
DOC_METHOD: >-
  <p>It is important that energy data collection and emissions calculations are
  consistent with international standards. CO<sub>2</sub> emissions need to be
  estimated based on energy data and on internationally agreed methodologies.
  Energy data are collected at a country level, based on internationally agreed
  standards (UN International Recommendations on Energy Statistics (IRES)). The
  IEA collects the energy data from countries, according to internationally
  agreed energy statistics definitions and estimates CO<sub>2</sub> emissions
  based on the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National GHG Inventories&#x2019;
  producing internationally comparable CO<sub>2</sub> emissions data for over
  150 countries and regions.</p>

  <p>The IEA collects energy data through standardised fuels specific
  questionnaires shared with OECD Member countries and more selected economies.
  These questionnaires are available at: </p>

  <p><a
  href="https://www.iea.org/areas-of-work/data-and-statistics/questionnaires">iea.org/areas-of-work/data-and-statistics/questionnaires</a>.</p>

  <p>The IEA energy balances for all other countries are based on national
  energy data of heterogeneous nature, converted and adapted to fit the IEA
  format and methodology based on IRES recommendations.</p>

  <p>More detail on methods and sources is available at: <a
  href="http://wds.iea.org/wds/pdf/WORLDBAL_Documentation.pdf">wds.iea.org/wds/pdf/WORLDBAL_Documentation.pdf</a>.</p>

  <p>For the underlying energy data, the reference is the UN International
  Recommendations on Energy Statistics, available at: <a
  href="https://unstats.un.org/unsd/energy/ires/">unstats.un.org/unsd/energy/ires/.</a>.
  </p>

  <p>To estimate CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, the internationally agreed reference
  is the 2006 IPCC Guidelines on National GHG Inventories available at: <a
  href="https://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2006gl/index.html">ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2006gl/</a>.
  </p>
QUALITY_MGMNT: >-
  <p>The IEA, in co-operation with the Statistical Office of the European
  Communities (Eurostat), has published an Energy Statistics Manual. This Manual
  helps the energy statisticians have a better grasp of definitions, units and
  methodologies. Moreover, IEA has established a quality management framework
  based on the internationally recognized guidelines recommended by IRES to
  ensure quality of statistical products. </p>
QUALITY_ASSURE: >-
  <p>The IEA has extensive data quality checks on the energy data submissions
  (around 30 statisticians working on it), and iterates with countries on data
  issues and how to address them. </p>

  <p>The IEA also works in cooperation with the IPCC and the UNFCCC to ensure
  the highest consistency between international methodologies and methodologies
  adopted at the IEA; the IEA validates energy data submitted to the UNFCCC by
  countries within their inventories. The IEA convenes international workshops
  among partner Agencies working on energy data to ensure consistency between
  energy data at global level is enhanced continuously, and methodologies are
  harmonised.</p>

  <p>The IEA has an extensive data quality assurance and validation process
  through exchange with national data providers worldwide. It also convenes its
  Energy Statistics Development Group meeting to discuss energy statistics
  developments with its Members, and cooperates with partners worldwide to
  ensure coherence of data and methods.</p>

  <p><a href="https://unstats.un.org/unsd/unsystem/Documents/QAF-UNIDO.pdf">The
  UNIDO Quality Assurance Framework</a> is followed to ensure that the
  statistical activities of UNIDO are relevant and the data compiled and
  disseminated are accurate, complete within the defined scope and coverage,
  timely, comparable in terms of internationally recommended methods and
  classification standards and internally coherent to variables included in the
  datasets. While these generally accepted, broad dimensions of quality of
  statistical data may be defined in each NSO&apos;s own quality assurance
  framework, UNIDO makes maximum effort that data produced from the statistical
  operation undertaken with the UNIDO technical cooperation are accurate,
  internationally comparable and coherent.</p>
COVERAGE: >-
  <p>Data availability:</p>

  <p>Data are available for more than 140 countries.</p>

  <p>Time series:</p>

  <p>Data for this indicator are available as of 2000 in the UN Global SDG
  Database, but longer time series are available in the IEA database (IEA
  CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from fuel combustion) and the UNIDO MVA database.</p>

  <p>Disaggregation:</p>

  <p>Data can be presented for national totals, for the manufacturing sector,
  and by industrial subsector.</p>
COMPARABILITY: >-
  <p>Sources of discrepancies:</p>

  <p>The IEA CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from fuel combustion, used for calculating
  these indicators, is a global database obtained following harmonised
  definitions and comparable methodologies across countries. However, it does
  not represent an official source for national GHG inventories submissions by
  the countries.</p>

  <p>Difference may arise due to different sources of official energy data,
  dissimilarities in the underlying methodologies, adjustments and estimations.
  More information on these sources of differences is available in the IEA
  database documentation file available at:</p>

  <p><a
  href="http://wds.iea.org/wds/pdf/Worldco2_Documentation.pdf">wds.iea.org/wds/pdf/Worldco2_Documentation.pdf</a></p>

  <p>Additionally, difference may arise if the country has not submitted energy
  consumption data adequately dis-aggregated by sector or by energy sources
  and/or due to conversion of value data into USD.</p>
