  <p>Definitions:</p>

  <p>Carbon dioxide (here after, CO<sub>2</sub>) emissions per unit of value
  added is an indicator computed as ratio between CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from
  fuel combustion and the value added of associated economic activities. The
  indicator can be computed for the whole economy (total CO<sub>2</sub>
  emissions/GDP) or for specific sectors, notably the manufacturing sector
  (CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from manufacturing industries per manufacturing
  value added (MVA). </p>

  <p>CO<sub>2</sub> emissions per unit of GDP are expressed in kilogrammes of
  CO<sub>2</sub> per unit of purchasing power parity GDP in constant 2017 USD.
  CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from manufacturing industries per unit of MVA are
  measured in kilogrammes of CO<sub>2</sub> equivalent per unit of MVA in
  constant 2015 USD.</p>

  <p>Concepts:</p>

  <p>Total CO<sub>2</sub> emissions for an economy are estimated based on energy
  consumption data for all sectors.</p>

  <p>CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from manufacturing are based on energy data
  collected across the following subsectors (energy used for transport by
  industry is not included here but reported under transport):</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Iron and steel industry [ISIC Group 241 and Class 2431];</li>
    <li>Chemical and petrochemical industry [ISIC Divisions 20 and 21] excluding petrochemical feedstocks;</li>
    <li>Non-ferrous metals basic industries [ISIC Group 242 and Class 2432];</li>
    <li>Non-metallic minerals such as glass, ceramic, cement, etc. [ISIC Division 23];</li>
    <li>Transport equipment [ISIC Divisions 29 and 30];</li>
    <li>Machinery comprises fabricated metal products, machinery and equipment other than transport equipment [ISIC Divisions 25 to 28];</li>
    <li>Food and tobacco [ISIC Divisions 10 to 12];</li>
    <li>Paper, pulp and printing [ISIC Divisions 17 and 18];</li>
    <li>Wood and wood products (other than pulp and paper) [ISIC Division 16];</li>
    <li>Textile and leather [ISIC Divisions 13 to 15];</li>
    <li>Non-specified (any manufacturing industry not included above) [ISIC Divisions 22, 31 and 32].</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Energy data are collected at a country level, based on internationally
  agreed standards (UN International Recommendations on Energy Statistics
  (IRES)). CO<sub>2</sub> emissions need to be estimated based on energy data
  and on internationally agreed methodologies (2006 IPCC Guidelines for National
  GHG Inventories). </p>

  <p>The IEA collects national energy data, according to internationally agreed
  energy statistics definitions and estimates CO<sub>2</sub> emissions based on
  the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National GHG Inventories&#x2019; Tier 1
  methodology, producing internationally comparable CO<sub>2</sub> emissions
  data for over 150 countries and regions.</p>

  <p>The gross value added measures the contribution to the economy of each
  individual producer, industry or sector in a country. The gross value added
  generated by any unit engaged in production activity can be calculated as the
  residual of the units&#x2019; total output less intermediate consumption,
  goods and services used up in the process of producing the output, or as the
  sum of the factor incomes generated by the production process (System of
  National Accounts 2008). Manufacturing refers to industries belonging to the
  sector C defined by International Standard Industrial Classification of All
  Economic Activities (ISIC) Revision 4, or D defined by ISIC Revision 3.</p>

  <p>GDP represents the sum of gross value added from all institutional units
  resident in the economy. For the purpose on comparability over time and across
  countries, GDP based on purchasing power parity (PPP) is used to calculate the
  total CO<sub>2</sub> emissions intensity of the economy. MVA is estimated in
  terms of constant prices in USD. The current series are given at constant
  prices of 2015.</p>

SOURCE_TYPE: >-
  <p>Data on total CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from fuel combustion, also
  disaggregated by sector, are taken from the International Energy Agency (IEA)
  CO<sub>2</sub> Emissions from Fuel Combustion database available at: (<a
  href="https://www.iea.org/reports/co2-emissions-from-fuel-combustion-2019">iea.org/reports/co2-emissions-from-fuel-combustion-2019</a>).</p>

  <p>The IEA produces the indicator on total CO<sub>2</sub> emissions/GDP, based
  on secondary sources for GDP (World Bank Development indicators and the
  National Accounts &#x2013; Analysis of Main Aggregates (AMA)).</p>

  <p>UNIDO maintains the MVA database. Figures for updates are obtained from
  national account estimates produced by UN Statistics Division (UNSD) and from
  national publications.</p>
COLL_METHOD: >-
  <p>The IEA collects energy data at the national level according to harmonised
  international definitions and questionnaires, as described in the UN
  International Recommendations for Energy Statistics available at : (<a
  href="https://unstats.un.org/unsd/energy/ires/">unstats.un.org/unsd/energy/ires/</a>).</p>

  <p>The estimates of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from fuel combustion are
  calculated by the IEA based on the IEA energy data and the default methods and
  emission factors from the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National GHG Inventories
  available at: (<a
  href="http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2006gl/">ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2006gl/</a>).
  More information on methodologies from the IEA is available at: <a
  href="http://wds.iea.org/wds/pdf/Worldco2_Documentation.pdf">wds.iea.org/wds/pdf/Worldco2_Documentation.pdf</a></p>

  <p>The most recent GDP estimates published by the World Bank with reference
  year of 2017 have been used when calculating CO<sub>2</sub> emissions per unit
  of GDP indicator. Additionally, missing years for countries with at least one
  data point for GDP reported by the World Bank have been estimated using
  National Accounts &#x2013; Analysis of Main Aggregates (AMA) growth rates.</p>

  <p>For the calculation of the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from manufacturing
  industries per unit of MVA indicator, the MVA and GDP country data are
  collected through a national accounts questionnaire (NAQ) sent by UNSD. More
  information on the methodology is available at:</p>

  <p><strong>Name:</strong></p>

  <p>UNIDO, IEA</p>

  <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>

  <p>IEA provides data on total CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, CO<sub>2</sub>
  emissions/GDP PPP and manufacturing CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.</p>

  <p>UNIDO compiles the data using its source for MVA data and IEA for data on
  CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.</p>
INST_MANDATE: >-
  <p>IEA as one of the custodian agencies responsible for monitoring progress
  towards the SDG 7.3 target, leverage on their national data efforts and add
  value by promoting coherent standards, definitions and methodologies for both
  raw data and the derived indicators with the ultimate goal of producing
  international comparable datasets. </p>

  <p>UNIDO, as the specialized UN agency on industrial development, has the
  international mandate for collecting, producing and disseminating
  internationally comparable industrial statistics. UNIDO&#x2019;s mandate
  covers (i) the maintenance and updating of international industrial statistics
  databases; (ii) methodological and analytical products based on statistical
  research and experience of maintaining internationally comparable statistics;
  (iii) contributions to the development and implementation of international
  statistical standards and methodology; and (iv) technical cooperation services
  to countries in the field of industrial statistics. With the repositioning of
  UNIDO as the focal agency for inclusive and sustainable industrial development
  (ISID), its statistical mandate was expanded to cover all dimensions of
  industrial development, including its inclusiveness and environmental
  sustainability.</p>
OTHER_METHOD: ''
RATIONALE: >-
  <p>The indicator CO<sub>2</sub> emissions per unit of value added represents
  the amount of emissions from fuel combustion produced by an economic activity,
  per unit of economic output. When computed for the whole economy, it combines
  effects of the average carbon intensity of the energy mix (linked to the
  shares of the various fossil fuels in the total); of the structure of an
  economy (linked to the relative weight of more or less energy-intensive
  sectors); of the average efficiency in the use of energy. When computed for
  the manufacturing sector (CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from fuel combustion per
  unit of manufacturing value added), it measures the carbon intensity of the
  manufacturing economic output, and its trends result from changes in the
  average carbon intensity of the energy mix used, the structure of the
  manufacturing sector, the energy efficiency of production technologies in each
  sub-sector and the economic value of the various output. Manufacturing
  industries are generally improving their emission intensity as countries move
  to higher levels of industrialization, but it should be noted that emission
  intensities can also be reduced through structural changes and product
  diversification in manufacturing. </p>

  <p>CO<sub>2</sub> emission accounts for around 80% of all GHG emission from
  the manufacturing processes. </p>
REC_USE_LIM: >-
  <p>Estimation of CO<sub>2</sub> emission data is not systematized in many
  countries, although is performed internationally based on harmonised energy
  data collected at national level. Energy data collection is generally well
  established, although in some cases national methodologies may differ from
  internationally agreed methodologies. National data sources include
  statistical offices, energy ministries, environment agencies, among others.
  Energy consumption data and value added data are coming from different data
  sources which may raise some consistency issues.</p>
