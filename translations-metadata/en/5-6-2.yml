  <p>Definition:</p>

  <p>Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) Indicator 5.6.2 seeks to measure the
  extent to which countries have national laws and regulations that guarantee
  full and equal access to women and men aged 15 years and older to sexual and
  reproductive health care, information and education. </p>

  <p>The indicator is a percentage (%) scale of 0 to 100 (national laws and
  regulations exist to guarantee full and equal access), indicating a
  country&#x2019;s status and progress in the existence of such national laws
  and regulations. Indicator 5.6.2 measures only the existence of laws and
  regulations; it does not measure their implementation. </p>

  <p>Concepts:</p>

  <p>Laws: laws and statutes are official rules of conduct or action prescribed,
  or formally recognized as binding, or enforced by a controlling authority that
  governs the behavior of actors (including people, corporations, associations,
  government agencies). They are adopted or ratified by the legislative branch
  of government and may be formally recognized in the Constitution or
  interpreted by courts. Laws governing sexual and reproductive health are not
  necessarily contained in one law. </p>

  <p>Regulations: are considered to be executive, ministerial or other
  administrative orders or decrees. At the municipal level, regulations are
  sometimes called ordinances. Regulations and ordinances issued by governmental
  entities have the force of law, although circumscribed by the level of the
  issuing authority. Under this methodology, only regulations with
  national-level application are considered. </p>

  <p>Restrictions: many laws and regulations contain restrictions in the scope
  of their applicability. Such restrictions, which include, though are not
  limited to, those by age, sex, marital status, and requirement for third party
  authorization, represent barriers to full and equal access to sexual and
  reproductive health care, information and education. </p>

  <p>Plural legal systems: are defined as legal systems in which multiple
  sources of law co-exist. Such legal systems have typically developed over a
  period of time as a consequence of colonial inheritance, religion and other
  socio-cultural factors. Examples of sources of law that might co-exist under a
  plural legal system include: English common law, French civil or other law,
  statutory law, and customary and religious law. The co-existence of multiple
  sources of law can create fundamental contradictions in the legal system,
  which result in barriers to full and equal access to sexual and reproductive
  health care, information and education. </p>

  <p>&#x201C;Guarantee&#x201D; (access): for the purpose of this methodology,
  &#x201C;guarantee&#x201D; is understood in relation to a law or regulation
  that assures a particular outcome or condition. The methodology recognizes
  that laws can only guarantee &#x201C;in principle&#x201D;; for the outcomes to
  be fully realized in practice, additional steps, including policy and
  budgetary measures will need to be in place.</p>
UNIT_MEASURE: <p>Proportion</p>
CLASS_SYSTEM: >-
  <p>Adopted by 179 governments, the 1994 International Conference on Population
  and Development Programme of Action marked a fundamental shift in global
  thinking on population and development issues. It moved away from a focus on
  reaching specific demographic targets to a focus on the needs, aspirations and
  rights of individual women and men. The Programme of Action asserted that
  everyone counts, that the true focus of development policy must be the
  improvement of individual lives and the measure of progress should be the
  extent to which we address inequalities. For more information on ICPD
  Programme of Action, please visit

  <p>Indicator 5.6.2 is calculated based on official government responses
  collected through the United Nations Inquiry among Governments on Population
  and Development. The Inquiry, mandated by the General Assembly in its
  resolution 1838 (XVII) of 18 December 1962, has been conducted by the
  Secretary-General since 1963. All questions required for indicator 5.6.2 are
  integrated into Module II on fertility, family planning and reproductive
  health of the Inquiry.</p>
COLL_METHOD: >-
  <p>The Inquiry is sent to the Permanent Missions by UN Population Division
  (DESA). UNFPA then follow-up with UNFPA Country Offices to facilitate the data
  submissions from national governments. </p>
FREQ_COLL: >-
  <p>Baseline data is collected in 2019. Next data collection through the United
  Nations 13th Inquiry among Governments on Population and Development will be
  closed in March 2021. Further data collection will be scheduled every 4
  years.</p>
REL_CAL_POLICY: <p>Every 2-4 years.</p>
DATA_SOURCE: >-
  <p>Data will be provided by relevant government ministries, departments and
  agencies.</p>
COMPILING_ORG: '<p>UNFPA, in collaboration with UN Population Division. </p>'
INST_MANDATE: >-
  <p>The mandate of UNFPA, as established by the United Nations Economic and
  Social Council (ECOSOC) in 1973 and reaffirmed in 1993, is (1) to build the
  knowledge and the capacity to respond to needs in population and family
  planning; (2) to promote awareness in both developed and developing countries
  of population problems and possible strategies to deal with these problems;
  (3) to assist their population problems in the forms and means best suited to
  the individual countries&apos; needs; (4) to assume a leading role in the
  United Nations system in promoting population programmes, and to coordinate
  projects supported by the Fund.</p>

  <p> </p>

  <p>At the International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD), held
  in Cairo in 1994, these broad ideas were elaborated to emphasize the gender
  and human rights dimensions of population. UNFPA was given the lead in helping
  countries carry out the Programme of Action adopted by 179 governments at the
  Cairo Conference. In 2010, the United Nations General Assembly extended the
  ICPD beyond 2014, which was original end date for the 20-year Programme of
  Action.</p>
RATIONALE: >-
  <p>Indicator 5.6.2 seeks to provide the first comprehensive global assessment
  of legal and regulatory frameworks in line with the 1994 International
  Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) Programme of Action<sup><a
  href="#footnote-2" id="footnote-ref-2">[1]</a></sup>, the Beijing Platform for
  Action<sup><a href="#footnote-3" id="footnote-ref-3">[2]</a></sup>, and
  international human rights standards<sup><a href="#footnote-4"
  id="footnote-ref-4">[3]</a></sup>. The indicator measures the legal and
  regulatory environment across four thematic sections, defined as the key
  parameters of sexual and reproductive health care, information and education
  according to these international consensus documents and human rights
  standards:</p>

  <table>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>
          <p>Maternity care</p>

  <p>Each of the four thematic areas (sections) is represented by individual
  components, reflecting topics that are: i) critical from a substantive
  perspective, ii) span a broad spectrum of sexual and reproductive health care,
  information and education, and iii) the subject of national legal and
  regulatory frameworks. In total, Indicator 5.6.2 measures 13 components,
  categorized as follows:</p>

  </table>

  <p>For each of the 13 components, information is collected on the existence of
  i) specific legal <em>enablers</em> (positive laws and regulations) and ii)
  specific legal <em>barriers</em><sup><a href="#footnote-5"
  id="footnote-ref-5">[4]</a></sup>. Such barriers encompass
  <em>restrictions</em> to positive laws and regulations (e.g. by age, sex,
  marital status and requirement for third party authorization), as well as
  <em>plural legal systems that contradict</em> co-existing positive laws and
  regulations. For each component, the specific enablers and barriers on which
  data are collected are defined as the principle enablers and barriers for that
  component. Even where positive laws are in place, legal barriers can undermine
  <em>full and equal</em> access to sexual and reproductive health care,
  information and education; the methodology is designed to capture this.</p>

  <p>The percentage value reflects a country&#x2019;s status and progress in the
  existence of national laws and regulations that guarantee full and equal
  access to sexual and reproductive health care, information, and education. By
  reflecting the &#x201C;extent to which&#x201D; countries guarantee full and
  equal access to sexual and reproductive health care, information and
  education, this indicator allows across country comparison and within-country
  progress over time to be captured. </p><div class="footnotes"><div><sup

  <p>Indicator 5.6.2 measures exclusively the existence of laws and regulations
  and their barriers. It does not measure the implementation of such
  laws/regulations. In addition, the 13 components are intended to be indicative
  of sexual and reproductive health care, information and education, instead of
  a complete or exhaustive list of the care, information and education. These
  components were selected because they were identified as key parameters
  according to international consensus documents and human rights standards.</p>
DATA_COMP: >-
  <p>The indicator measures specific legal enablers and barriers for 13
  components across four sections. The calculation of the indicator requires
  data for all 13 components.</p>

  <p>The 13 components are placed on the same scale, with 0% being the lowest
  value and 100% being the most optimal value. Each component is calculated
  independently and weighted equally. Each <u>component</u> is calculated
  as:</p>
