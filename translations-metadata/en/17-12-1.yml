  countries are transparent and simple, and contribute to facilitating market

  <p><strong>Definition:</strong></p>

  <p>Average import tariffs (in per cent) faced by products exported from
  developing countries and least developed countries.</p>

  <p><strong>Concepts:</strong></p>

  <p>Tariffs: Tariffs are customs duties on merchandise imports, levied either
  on an ad valorem basis (percentage of value) or on a specific basis (e.g. $7
  per 100 kg). Tariffs can be used to create a price advantage for similar
  locally-produced goods and for raising government revenues. Trade remedy
  measures and taxes are not considered to be tariffs. Tariff in HS chapters
  01-97 is taken into consideration.</p>

  <p>Tariff line or National Tariff lines (NTL): National Tariff Line codes
  refer to the classification codes, applied to merchandise goods by individual
  countries that are longer than the HS six digit level. Countries are free to
  introduce national distinctions for tariffs and many other purposes.</p>

  <p>The national tariff line codes are based on the HS system but are longer
  than six digits. For example, the six digit HS code 010120 refers to Asses,
  mules and hinnies, live, whereas the US National Tariff line code 010120.10
  refers to live purebred breeding asses, 010120.20 refers to live asses other
  than purebred breeding asses and 010120.30 refers to mules and hinnies
  imported for immediate slaughter.</p>
SOURCE_TYPE: >-
  <p>The main information used to calculate indicators 17.12.1 is import tariff
  data. Information on import tariffs might be retrieved by contacting directly
  National statistical offices, permanent country missions to the UN, regional
  organizations or focal points within the customs, ministries in charge of
  customs revenues (Ministry of economy/finance and related revenue authorities)
  or, alternatively, the Ministry of trade. Tariff data for the calculation of
  this indicator are retrieved from ITC (MAcMap) - http://www.macmap.org/ - WTO
  (IDB) - http://tao.wto.org - and UNCTAD (TRAINS) databases. Import tariff data
  included in the ITC (MAcMap) database are collected by contacting directly
  focal points in line national agencies or regional organizations (in the case
  of custom unions or regional economic communities). When available, data are
  downloaded from national or regional official websites. In some cases, data
  are purchased from private companies. Import tariff data included in the WTO
  (IDB) database are sourced from official notifications of WTO members. Import
  tariff included in the UNCTAD (TRAINS) database are collected from official
  sources, including official country or regional organizations websites.</p>
FREQ_COLL: <p>Continuously updated all year round</p>
REL_CAL_POLICY: >-
  <p>Indicatively the indicator&#x2019;s calculations can be ready by March
  every year. However, the date of release will depend on the period envisaged
  for the launching of the SDG monitoring report.</p>

  <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
  <p>ITC, WTO and UNCTAD will jointly report on this indicator</p>
RATIONALE: >-
  <p>The average level of customs tariff rates faced by developing countries and
  LDCs allows observing at which pace the multilateral system is advancing
  toward the implementation of duty-free and quota-free market access.</p>
REC_USE_LIM: >-
  <p>&quot;The reduction of average tariffs on key sector as agriculture can
  represent a proxy of the level of commitment of developed country to improve
  market access conditions.</p>

  <p>In terms of limitations:</p>

  <p>Tariffs are only part of the trade limitation factors to the implementation
  of duty-free and quota-free market access, especially when looking at exports
  of developing or least developed countries under non-reciprocal preferential
  treatment that set criteria for eligibility. Accurate estimates on non-tariff
  measures do not exist, thus the calculations on market access are limited to
  tariffs only.</p>

  <p>A full coverage of preferential schemes of developed countries has been
  used for the computation, but preferential treatment may not be fully used by
  developing countries&apos; exporters for different reasons such as the
  inability of certain exporters to meet eligibility criteria (i.e., complying
  with rules of origin).&quot;</p>
DATA_COMP: >-
  <p>Some tariff rates which are not expressed in ad valorem form (e.g.,
  specific duties) need to be converted in ad valorem equivalents (i.e. in per
  cent of the import value). The conversion is made at the tariff line level for
  each importer by using the unit value method. Import unit values are
  calculated from import values and quantities. Only a limited number of non-ad
  valorem tariff rates (i.e. technical duties) cannot be provided with ad
  valorem equivalents (AVE) and are excluded from the calculation. This
  methodology also allows for cross-country comparisons.</p>
