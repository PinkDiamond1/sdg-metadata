  <p><strong>Definitions:</strong></p>

  <p>Passenger and freight volumes are respectively measured in
  passenger-kilometres and tonne-kilometres, and broken down by mode of
  transport. For the purposes of monitoring this indicator, passenger-km data
  are split between aviation, road (broken down between passenger cars, buses
  and motorcycles) and rail, and tonne-km are split between aviation, road, rail
  and inland waterways. </p>

  <p><strong>Concepts:</strong></p>

  <p>Aviation:</p>

  <p>The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) through its Statistics
  Division has established standard methodologies and definitions to collect and
  report traffic (passenger and freight volume) data related to air transport.
  These standards and methodologies have been adopted by the 193 Member States
  of ICAO and also by the Industry stakeholders i.e. air carriers and airports.
  The data of ICAO is used by States and also the World Bank for its development
  indicators. ICAO uses Air Transport Reporting Forms A, AS, B and C to arrive
  at the passenger and freight volumes for air transport.</p>

  <p>Precise definition of all different concepts and metadata related to Air
  Transport Reporting Forms A, AS, B and C to arrive at the passenger and
  freight volumes for air transport, as approved by the ICAO Statistics Division
  and Member States can be found at the ICAO website given below -</p>

  <p><strong>Definitions:</strong></p>

  <p>International maritime freight is an indicator reflecting (1) the sum of
  international freight volumes loaded (exports) and unloaded (imports) at ports
  worldwide and measured in metric tonnes, and (2) container port traffic at
  world ports measured in twenty-foot equivalent unit (TEU).</p>

  <p>Data is collected by the UNCTAD secretariat from various sources, including
  industry, government and specialised maritime transport data providers and
  consultancies. Volumes are expressed in metric tonnes and twenty-foot
  equivalent unit (TEU).</p>

  <p>As data on international maritime freight volumes are not widely available,
  only the data in tonnes (rather than tonne-km) and at the regional level are
  reported.</p>

  <p>Data at country level are available for container port traffic measured in
  twenty-foot equivalent unit (TEU).</p>

  <p><strong>Concepts:</strong></p>

  <p>The UNCTAD secretariat collects and compiles the data from various websites
  and reports, including, by port and industry associations and authorities,
  national statistics offices, UN Monthly Bulletin of Statistics, governments,
  specialised agencies such as the International Energy Agency (IEA), the US
  Energy Information Administration (EIA), the Organization of the Petroleum
  Exporting Countries (OPEC), and British Petroleum (BP). Data is also collected
  from reports issued by maritime specialised sources such as Drewry Maritime
  Research (DMR), Clarksons Research Services (CRS), Dynamar, and Lloyd&#x2019;s
  List Intelligence (LLI).</p>

  <p>Road, Rail, Inland waterways, Pipelines</p>

  <p>The ITF and UNECE, in collaboration with Eurostat, collect data on rail and
  road, inland waterway and pipeline statistics on an annual basis from all
  their collective Member countries. Data are collected from Transport
  Ministries, statistical offices and other institution designated as official
  data source. Although there are clear definitions for all the terms used in
  this survey, countries might have different methodologies to calculate
  tonne-kilometres and passenger-kilometres. Methods could be based on traffic
  or mobility surveys, use very different sampling methods and estimating
  techniques which could affect the comparability of their statistics. </p>

  <p>Official statistics for road, rail, inland waterways and pipeline transport
  are only available for UNECE or ITF member States. Data for these modes for
  other countries come from the ITF&#x2019;s global transport model.</p>

  <p>For definitions of all relevant terms, the UNECE/ITF/Eurostat Glossary for
  Transport Statistics can be consulted. The 5<sup>th</sup> edition of this

  <p>ICAO:</p>

  <p>ICAO is funded and directed by 193 national governments to support their
  diplomacy and cooperation in air transport as signatory states to the Chicago
  Convention (1944). Its core function is to maintain an administrative and
  expert bureaucracy (the ICAO Secretariat) supporting these diplomatic
  interactions, and to research new air transport policy and standardization
  innovations as directed and endorsed by governments through the ICAO Assembly,
  or by the ICAO Council which the assembly elects.</p>

  <p>https://www.icao.int/about-icao/Pages/default.aspx</p>

  <p>UNCTAD:</p>

  <p>Established in 1964, the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development
  (UNCTAD), published its annual Review of Maritime Transport for the first time
  in 1968. The publication is part of UNCTAD&apos;s research and analytical work
  in the field of maritime transport aimed at helping developing countries
  maximize their trade and investment opportunities and increase their
  participation in the world economy. It has been regularly reconfirmed in the
  quadrennial Ministerial Conferences, most recently by UNCTAD XIII in Doha
  (2012) and UNCTAD XIV in Nairobi (2016). The mandates emanating from these
  conferences have emphasized sustainable and resilient transport as priority
  action areas and established &#x201C;Sustainable and Climate Resilient
  Maritime Transport&#x201D; as an important thematic area n UNCTAD&#x2019;s
  work programme and the Review of Maritime Transport. </p>

  <p>ITF:</p>

  <p>The International Transport Forum (ITF) was created by Ministerial
  Declaration in Dublin in 2006 on the legal basis of the European Conference of
  Ministers of Transport (ECMT), itself established as an international
  organisation by treaty (Protocol) signed in Brussels on 17 October 1953. The
  objectives of the ITF are to serve as a global platform for discussion and
  prenegotiation of transport policy issues across all modes. Unique in its
  global and modal scope, the ITF works to foster a deeper understanding of the
  role of transport in economic growth, environmental sustainability and social
  inclusion. It aspires to raise the public profile of transport policy.</p>
RATIONALE: >-
  <p>Develop quality, reliable, sustainable and resilient infrastructure,
  including regional and trans-border infrastructure, to support economic
  development and human well-being, with a focus on affordable and equitable
  access for all. Trans-border infrastructure development is best captured by
  passenger and freight volumes moved by Member States and Regions. A growth in
  passenger and freight volumes shows a robust infrastructure development
  happening in States and Regions along with the resultant socio-economic
  benefit. Air Transport is particularly important not only for the economic and
  job benefits but also because it is one of the only mode of transport that can
  be relied on during emergencies and disease outbreaks to reach food,
  medicines, medical personnel, vaccines and other supplies speedily to the
  affected persons in the affected areas. In addition, tracking how the non-road
  share of freight volumes, and the public transport share of passenger volumes,
  changes over time allows insights into the overall sustainability of the
  global transport system.</p>

  <p><em>Aviation:</em></p>

  <p>Informed decision-making is the foundation upon which successful businesses
  are built. In a fast-growing industry like aviation, planners and investors
  require the most comprehensive, up-to-date, and reliable data. ICAO&#x2019;s
  aviation data/statistics programme is to provide accurate, reliable and
  consistent aviation data so that States, international organizations, aviation
  industry, tourism and other stakeholders can make better projections. The UN
  recognized ICAO as the central agency responsible for the collection,
  analysis, publication, standardization, improvement and dissemination of
  statistics pertaining to civil aviation.</p>

  <p><em>Maritime:</em></p>

  <p>The volume of international maritime freight and container port traffic
  movements provide an overall indication of the importance of port
  infrastructure for trade and development and may be relied upon to infer the
  quality and adequacy of seaports and their hinterland connections. Maritime
  transport is the dominant mode of international freight transport when flows
  are measured in volume terms. Behind the global and regional headline
  estimates, individual contributions vary by region and type of cargo,
  reflecting, among other factors, differences in countries&#x2019; economic
  structures, composition of trade, urbanization, levels of development, extent
  of integration into global trading networks, degree of participation in global
  supply chains, and the quality of transport infrastructure.</p>

  <p>World container port traffic reflects the importance of containerized trade
  and countries&#x2019; participation in global liner shipping networks and
  globalized manufacturing production processes.</p>

  <p><em>Aviation:</em></p>

  <p>Coverage for aviation is for all ICAO 193 Member States.</p>

  <p><em>Maritime: </em></p>

  sub-regional level.</p>

  <p>Coverage for road, rail, inland waterways and pipelines is for all U.N.
  member States, but these are sourced from official statistics only for UNECE
  member States and ITF member States (and only when available). In order to
  provide a worldwide regional coverage, data from the ITF transport models are
  used (see point 4.f). </p>
DATA_COMP: >-
  <p>Aviation</p>

  <p>The aviation passenger and freight volumes are reported for the air
  carriers through ICAO Air Transport Reporting Forms and grouped by Member
  States of ICAO.</p>

  <p>Road/Rail/Inland waterways/Pipelines</p>

  <p>Data for each inland mode are reported to UNECE/ITF/Eurostat by member
  States, through an annual data collection using the transport statistics web
  common questionnaire.</p>

  <p>Maritime:</p>

  <p>The indicator is calculated through a sum of international maritime freight
  volumes and container port traffic as collected by UNCTAD secretariat from
  websites and reports by various industry, government and specialised maritime
  transport data providers and consultancies. Data on international maritime
  freight excludes transhipments and domestic maritime freight volumes.</p>

  <p>Cargo flows originating in or destined to landlocked countries are
  attributed to the ports of neighbouring coastal transit countries. The mode of
  transport &#x201C;maritime&#x201D; is assigned to an international trade
  transaction when the goods arrived at the country&#x2019;s external border
  (the seaport) transported by ship. </p>

  <p>Data on container port traffic include full and empty containers as well as
  transhipment traffic. </p>

  <p>Data is collected and compiled from various websites and reports,
  including, by port and industry associations and authorities, national
  statistics offices, UN Monthly Bulletin of Statistics, governments,
  specialised agencies such as the International Energy Agency (IEA), the US
  Energy Information Administration (EIA), the Organization of the Petroleum
  Exporting Countries (OPEC), and British Petroleum (BP). Data is also collected
  from reports issued by maritime specialised sources such as Drewry Maritime
  Research (DMR), Clarksons Research Services (CRS), Dynamar, and Lloyd&#x2019;s
  List Intelligence (LLI).</p>
DATA_VALIDATION: >-
  <p>Aviation:</p>

  <p>ICAO Statistics Programme has put in place a series of robust data quality
  control functions to automate all the necessary calculations and producing a
  report for each reporting form. These quality control processes were divided
  into two main activities: verification and validation.</p>

  <p>Maritime:</p>

  <p>UNCTAD secretariat monitors, collects, and compiles the data at the country
  level as well as at regional/sub-regional level. It continuously updates the
  data as new data and information becomes available. Some commercial providers
  of maritime statistics publish global data that is derived, for example, from
  shipping contracts, and UNCTAD compares its own data with those published by
  commercial providers. </p>

  transport models are used (see point 4.f). </p>
IMPUTATION: >-
  <p><strong>&#x2022; At country level </strong></p>

  <p><u>Aviation data are broadly complete.</u></p>

  <p><u>For inland transport statistics:</u> In case of missing data for a
  country for which at least one data point is available since 2000, we
  calculate estimates based on the expected growth rate for the country. The
  growth rates are computed from other socio-economic variables, such as Gross
  Domestic Product (GDP), population or urbanization.</p>

  <p><u>For road, rail, and inland waterways:</u> For non-ITF/UNECE countries,
  countries that did not submit a response, or when there is uncertainty
  regarding the provided data, data points are estimated using the ITF models,
  which use several covariates such as GDP, population, transport network
  coverage and more. Currently there are four global models used for this
  analysis: the urban passenger model, the non-urban passenger model, the
  international freight model and the urban freight model. A description of the
  four models can be found in the ITF Transport Outlook 2021 or in the following
  resources.</p>

    <li>ITF (2021) ITF Transport Outlook 2021, OECD Publishing </li>
    <li>ITF (2020) Decarbonising Transport in Europe, Project webpage</li>
  </ul>

  <p><em>Maritime:</em></p>

  <p>International maritime freight: In case of missing data for a country or a
  sub-region for which a data point is available since 2006, UNCTAD makes an
  estimate based on the expected growth rate of the volume of merchandise trade.
  If not available, use is made of the latest year for which data was
  available.</p>

  <p>Container port traffic: In case of missing data, UNCTAD makes an estimate
  by extrapolating from the liner shipping connectivity and ship capacity
  deployment data, which has shown to be highly correlated with container port
  traffic. Container ship deployment data are available for all container ships
  of the world, which thus allows for estimates on container port traffic to be
  generated even if no national data is available. In other cases, UNCTAD makes
  an estimate based on the expected growth rate of the volume of merchandise
  trade.</p>

  <p>UNCTAD conducts annual checks of collected data by updating the data with
  latest data available and comparing the data for internal consistency, against
  previous years, or similar data published or produced by other sources,
  including commercial sources specialized maritime transport data providers and
  research entities. Correspondence is undertaken with countries when necessary
  to collect, compare or confirm relevant data.</p>

  <p>Road/Rail/Inland waterways/Pipelines</p>

  <p>The ITF and UNECE conduct annual checks of their jointly collected data,
  comparing the data for internal consistency, against previous years, and on a
  per capita basis across countries, to determine if the data appear reasonable.
  Significant correspondence is undertaken with the countries over potential
  errors, and common issues and challenges are discussed at both the ITF annual
  statistics meeting and the UNECE&#x2019;s annual Working Party on Transport
  Statistics.</p>

  <p>A common problem for many countries is that passenger-km are only collected
  for public transport. Given that private passenger cars form the majority of
  passenger trips in most countries, this would clearly significantly
  underestimate road passenger-km, which is why the breakdown where available
  between passenger cars, buses and motorcycles is given. </p>
