  <p><strong>Definitions:</strong></p>

  <p>Passenger and freight volumes are respectively measured in passenger-km and
  tonne-km, and broken down by mode of transport. For the purposes of monitoring
  this indicator, passenger-km data are split between aviation, road (broken
  down between passenger cars, buses and motorcycles) and rail, and tonne-km are
  split between aviation, road, rail and inland waterways. </p>

  <p>As maritime data are not widely available, only tonnes (rather than
  tonne-km) data at the regional level have been shared.</p>

  <p><strong>Concepts:</strong></p>

  <p>Aviation:</p>

  <p>The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) through its Statistics
  Division have established standard methodologies and definitions to collect
  and report traffic (passenger and freight volume) data related to air
  transport. These standards and methodologies have been adopted by the 191
  Member States of ICAO and also by the Industry stakeholders i.e. air carriers
  and airports. The data of ICAO is used by States and also the World Bank for
  its development indicators. ICAO uses Air Transport Reporting Forms A, AS, B
  and C to arrive at the passenger and freight volumes for air transport.</p>

  <p>Precise definition of all different concepts and metadata related to Air
  Transport Reporting Forms A, AS, B and C to arrive at the passenger and
  freight volumes for air transport. approved by the ICAO Statistics Division
  and Member States can be found at the ICAO website given below -</p>

  <p>Road, Rail, Inland waterways, Pipelines</p>

  <p>The ITF and UNECE, in collaboration with Eurostat, collect data on rail and
  road, inland waterway and pipeline statistics on an annual basis from all
  their collective Member countries. Data are collected from Transport
  Ministries, statistical offices and other institution designated as official
  data source. Although there are clear definitions for all the terms used in
  this survey, countries might have different methodologies to calculate
  tonne-kilometres and passenger-kilometres. Methods could be based on traffic
  or mobility surveys, use very different sampling methods and estimating
  techniques which could affect the comparability of their statistics. </p>

  <p>Official statistics for road, rail, inland waterways and pipeline transport
  are only available for UNECE or ITF member States. Data for these modes for
  other countries come from the ITF&#x2019;s global transport model.</p>

  <p>For definitions of all relevant terms, the UNECE/ITF/Eurostat Glossary for
  Transport Statistics can be consulted. The 5<sup>th</sup> edition of this
  publication should be released in 2019. The fourth edition from 2009 is
  available at <a

  <p>Aviation</p>

  <p>ICAO Air Transport Reporting Forms approved by the Statistics Division of
  ICAO and its Member States has been used to define standards, methodologies
  and to collect aviation data since the 1950&apos;s. ICAO definitions and
  metadata is also used by the Aviation Industry as the basis of collecting data
  and conducting analysis.</p>

  <p>Aviation</p>

  <p>Every year by June 10th data for the previous year is available to ICAO
  Member States at a country level. </p>

  <p>Road/Rail/Inland waterways/Pipelines</p>

  <p>Data are collected for the reference year starting in September of the

  <p>Develop quality, reliable, sustainable and resilient infrastructure,
  including regional and trans-border infrastructure, to support economic
  development and human well-being, with a focus on affordable and equitable
  access for all. Trans-border infrastructure development is best captured by
  passenger and freight volumes moved by Member States and Regions. A growth in
  passenger and freight volumes shows a robust infrastructure development
  happening in States and Regions along with the resultant socio-economic
  benefit. Air Transport is particularly important not only for the economic and
  job benefits but also because it is one of the only mode of transport that can
  be relied on during emergencies and disease outbreaks to reach food,
  medicines, medical personnel, vaccines and other supplies speedily to the
  affected persons in the affected areas. In addition, tracking how the non-road
  share of freight volumes, and the public transport share of passenger volumes,
  changes over time allows insights into the overall sustainability of the
  global transport system.</p>
REC_USE_LIM: >-
  <p>Coverage for aviation is for all ICAO 191 Member States.</p>

  <p>Coverage for road, rail, inland waterways and pipelines is for all U.N.
  member States, but these are sourced from official statistics only for UNECE
  member States and ITF member States (and only when available). </p>
DATA_COMP: >-
  <p>Aviation</p>

  <p>The aviation passenger and freight volumes are reported for the air
  carriers through ICAO Air Transport Reporting Forms and grouped by Member
  States of ICAO.</p>

  <p>Road/Rail/Inland waterways/Pipelines</p>

  <p>Data for each inland mode are reported to UNECE/ITF/Eurostat by member
  States, through an annual data collection using the transport statistics web
  common questionnaire.</p>
IMPUTATION: >-
  <p><strong>&#x2022; At country level </strong></p>

  <p><u>Aviation data are broadly complete.</u></p>

  <p><u>For inland transport statistics:</u> In case of missing data for a
  country for which at least one data point is available since 2000, we
  calculate estimates based on the expected growth rate for the country. The
  growth rates are computed from other socio-economic variables, such as Gross
  Domestic Product (GDP), population or urbanization.</p>

  <p>For non-ITF/UNECE countries, data points are estimated using the ITF model,
  which uses several covariates such as GDP, population, transport network
  coverage&#x2026; A description of the model can be found in the ITF Transport
  Outlook 2017.</p>

  <p>This model also uses several other data sources to make the calibration
  more robust in regions where ITF data does not have a good coverage.</p>

  <p>Metadata (explanations of coverage, breaks in series etc.) for the ITF and
  UNECE inland transport data are available through their respective online
  databases. The aforementioned Glossary for Transport Statistics provides
  definitions for passenger-km and tonne-km, but also for related terms such as
  what constitutes a passenger, the definitions and exclusions within each
  transport mode etc.</p>
QUALITY_ASSURE: >-
  <p>Road/Rail/Inland waterways/Pipelines</p>

  <p>The ITF and UNECE conduct annual checks of their jointly collected data,
  comparing the data for internal consistency, against previous years, and on a
  per capita basis across countries, to determine if the data appear reasonable.
  Significant correspondence is undertaken with the countries over potential
  errors, and common issues and challenges are discussed at both the ITF annual
  statistics meeting and the UNECE&#x2019;s annual Working Party on Transport
  Statistics.</p>

  <p>A common problem for many countries is that passenger-km are only collected
  for public transport. Given that private passenger cars form the majority of
  passenger trips in most countries, this would clearly significantly
  underestimate road passenger-km, which is why the breakdown where available
  between passenger cars, buses and motorcycles is given. </p>
