  <p>Proportion of firms asked for a gift or informal payment when meeting with
  tax officials. </p>

  <p>In every Enterprise Survey (www.enterprisesurveys.org), there is a standard
  question which asks the survey respondent if they were inspected by or
  required to meet with tax officials. If the respondent indicates
  &#x2018;yes&#x2019;, then there is a follow-up question which asks if the
  respondent was expected to provide a gift or an informal payment during these
  inspections/meetings. The response options include &#x201C;yes&#x201D;,
  &#x201C;no&#x201D;, &#x201C;don&#x2019;t know&#x201D;, and
  &#x201C;refuse&#x201D;.</p>

  <p>Enterprise Surveys are firm-level surveys conducted in World Bank client
  countries. The survey focuses on various aspects of the business environment
  as well as firm&#x2019;s outcome measures such as annual sales, productivity,
  etc. The surveys are conducted via face-to-face interviews with the top
  manager or business owner. For each country, the survey is conducted
  approximately every 4-5 years.</p>

  <p><strong>Concepts:</strong></p>

  <p>The respondents to the Enterprise Survey are firms- either manufacturing or
  services establishments. These are registered (formal) firms with 5+
  employees. The firms are either fully or partially private (100% state-owned
  firms are ineligible for the Enterprise Survey). More information on the
  survey methodology can be found on the Methodology page of the website:
  www.enterprisesurveys.org/methodology</p>

  <p>A gift or an informal payment is considered a &#x2018;bribe&#x2019;.</p>
SOURCE_TYPE: >-
  <p>The website for Enterprise Surveys (www.enterprisesurveys.org) provides all
  metadata, including survey questionnaires and implementation reports for all
  Enterprise Surveys. The implementation reports indicate the sample size,
  sample frame used, dates/duration of fieldwork, the response rates, etc.</p>

  <p>Registration to the Enterprise Survey&#x2019;s website is free and the
  website&#x2019;s data portal allows users to access the raw data and survey
  documentation for each survey.</p>
COLL_METHOD: >-
  <p>The World Bank conducts the Enterprise Surveys in client countries. The
  surveys are comparable as the survey methodology is applied in a consistent
  manner across countries: obtaining suitable sample frames, eligibility
  criteria for respondent firms, survey sample design, core questionnaire
  elements across every country, standardized QC checks on the received data,
  standardized computation of sampling weights, etc. </p>
FREQ_COLL: >-
  <p>The Surveys are ongoing. Information on current projects can be found at:
  http://www.enterprisesurveys.org/Methodology/Current-projects</p>
REL_CAL_POLICY: >-
  <p>The indicators on the Enterprise Surveys website are updated whenever a new
  survey has been completed and uploaded to the website. For each country, only
  the most recently completed survey is used when calculating the indicator.</p>
DATA_SOURCE: >-
  <p>The indicator is derived from Enterprise Surveys which are conducted by the
  World Bank. The World Bank usually hires a private contractor (typically a
  market research company) to conduct the survey fieldwork.</p>
COMPILING_ORG: <p>World Bank</p>
RATIONALE: >-
  <p>The rationale for this indicator is to ascertain whether firms are
  solicited for gifts or informal payments (i.e. bribes) when meeting with tax
  officials. Paying taxes are required of formal forms in most countries and
  hence the rational for this indicator is to measure the incidence of
  corruption during this routine interaction. The key strength of the Enterprise
  Survey is that most of the questions in the survey pertain to the actual,
  day-to-day experiences of the firm; this question regarding corruption during
  tax inspections/meetings is not an opinion-based question but rather a
  question grounded in the firm&#x2019;s reality.</p>

  <p>The key strength of the Enterprise Survey is that most of the questions in

  question regarding corruption during tax inspections/meetings is not an
  opinion-based question but rather a question grounded in the firm&#x2019;s
  reality.</p>

  <p>The limitations include that some countries&#x2019; data is almost 10 years
  old (e.g. South Africa and Brazil). This is due to the fact that these
  face-to-face survey projects can be expensive in some countries and hence due
  to budget limitations, the World Bank hasn&#x2019;t been able to update some
  of the Enterprise Surveys data in a subset of countries. Another limitation is
  that the surveys are done mostly in World Bank client countries and hence most
  high-income countries are not covered by the surveys (US, Canada, Western
  European countries, Japan, GCC countries, etc.).</p>

  <p>Another limitation may be the sensitive nature of corruption. In some
  countries/cultures, firms may not be comfortable answering questions on
  corruption. Although the data is collected under the context of
  confidentiality, firms may refuse to answer the question if they have been
  subject to bribery solicitations. Hence, in some countries, the actual
  incidence of this particular type of corruption may be higher than the
  calculated indicator value.</p>
DATA_COMP: >-
  <p>The indicator is calculated for each country, by looking at the proportion
  of firms which answered &#x2018;yes&#x2019; to the survey question. For all
  Enterprise Survey projects conducted since 2006, the resulting dataset has
  sampling weights. Hence the indicator value, which is computed using Stata,
  incorporates these sampling weights as well as the design strata.</p>
IMPUTATION: >-
  <p><strong>&#x2022; At country level</strong></p>

  <p>The indicator value is not imputed for countries which do not have an
  Enterprise Survey.</p>

  <p><strong>&#x2022; At regional and global levels</strong></p>

  <p>Regional and global aggregates of the indicator are derived from completed
  surveys. A single point estimate is created for each country and a
  global/regional aggregate takes a simple average of every country&#x2019;s
  point estimate (when there is available data for that country). For example
  the East Asia Pacific average (point estimate) for the indicator does not
  include Japan since there is no Enterprise Survey for Japan.</p>
REG_AGG: >-
  <p>Regional and global aggregates are computed by taking the simple average of
  the indicator value for all relevant countries. When producing regional and
  global aggregates as presented on the Enterprise Surveys website, note that
  only surveys posted during years 2010 onwards are used.</p>
DOC_METHOD: >-
  <p>We recommend users consult the Enterprise Surveys website to learn about
  the overall survey methodology and learn which countries are available for
  benchmarking purposes. <a

QUALITY_ASSURE: >-
  <p>When conducting our survey projects, the implementing fieldwork team must
  send periodic batches of completed interviews to the World Bank so that we can
  run our own quality control programs on the data. After running these
  programs, we provide the QC feedback to the implementing fieldwork team so
  that survey data, which has been flagged, can be verified and continuously
  improved. This is how we continuously monitor the survey data while the
  projects are in the field.</p>

  <p>The World Bank collects this survey data for the public good of
  information. For an individual survey project, once the data is collected and
  considered finalized (after our own internal QC processes), the survey data is
  published on the World Bank&#x2019;s Enterprise Surveys website.</p>
COVERAGE: >-
  <p><strong>Data availability:</strong></p>

  <p>Data Availability 2010 to present (in terms of countries having at least 1
  data point after 2010 for this indicator):</p>

  <p>Asia and Pacific: 28; Africa: 25; Latin America and Caribbean: 30; Europe,
  North America, Australia, New Zealand and Japan: 22.</p>

  <p><strong>Time series:</strong></p>

  <p><strong>Disaggregation:</strong></p>

  <p>The Enterprise Survey captures several descriptive characteristics of the
  respondent firms including: gender of top manager, primary business activity
  of the firm, subnational location of the firm, exporting status, number of
  employees, degree of foreign ownership, and several other characteristics.
  Hence the indicator can be disaggregated by the levels of these individual
  characteristics.</p>
