  <p><strong>Definitions:</strong></p>

  <p>Manufacturing value added (MVA) as a proportion of gross domestic product
  (GDP) is a ratio between MVA and GDP, both reported in constant 2015 USD.</p>

  <p>MVA per capita is calculated by dividing MVA in constant 2015 USD by
  population of a country or area.</p>

  <p><strong>Concepts:</strong></p>

  <p>The gross value added measures the contribution to the economy of each
  individual producer, industry or sector in a country. The gross value added
  generated by any unit engaged in production activity can be calculated as the
  residual of the units&#x2019; total output less intermediate consumption,
  goods and services used up in the process of producing the output, or as the
  sum of the factor incomes generated by the production process (System of
  National Accounts 2008). Manufacturing refers to industries belonging to the
  section C defined by International Standard Industrial Classification of All
  Economic Activities (ISIC) Revision 4, or D defined by ISIC Revision 3.</p>

  <p>GDP represents the sum of gross value added from all institutional units
  resident in the economy. For the purpose on comparability over time and across
  countries MVA and GDP are estimated in terms of constant prices in USD. The
  current series are given at constant prices of 2015.</p>

INST_MANDATE: >-
  <p>UNIDO, as the specialized UN agency on industrial development, has the
  international mandate for collecting, producing and disseminating
  internationally comparable industrial statistics. UNIDO&#x2019;s mandate
  covers (i) the maintenance and updating of international industrial statistics
  databases; (ii) methodological and analytical products based on statistical
  research and experience of maintaining internationally comparable statistics;
  (iii) contributions to the development and implementation of international
  statistical standards and methodology; and (iv) technical cooperation services
  to countries in the field of industrial statistics. With the repositioning of
  UNIDO as the focal agency for inclusive and sustainable industrial development
  (ISID), its statistical mandate was expanded to cover all dimensions of
  industrial development, including its inclusiveness and environmental
  sustainability.</p>
RATIONALE: >-
  <p>MVA is a well-recognized and widely used indicator by researchers and
  policy makers to assess the level of industrialization of a country. The share
  of MVA in GDP reflects the role of manufacturing in the economy and a
  country&#x2019;s national development in general. MVA per capita is the basic
  indicator of a country&#x2019;s level of industrialization adjusted for the
  size of the economy. One of the statistical uses of MVA per capita is
  classifying country groups according to the stage of industrial
  development.</p>
REC_USE_LIM: >-
  <p>Differences may appear due to different versions of System of National
  Accounts (SNA) or ISIC revisions used by countries.</p>

QUALITY_MGMNT: >-
  <p>The National Accounts Section of the UNSD supports the implementation
  programme of the SNA by developing and updating supporting normative
  standards, training material and compilation guidance for the implementation
  of national accounts and supporting economic statistics and maintaining a
  knowledge base on economic statistics. Moreover, UNSD provides substantive
  service to the Committee on Contributions of the Fifth Committee of the United
  Nations on technical aspects of the elements of scale methodology for
  assessing the contributions to the United Nations by Member States. UNIDO
  collects and disseminates National Accounts statistics in consultation with
  UNSD.</p>
QUALITY_ASSURE: >-
  <p><a href="https://unstats.un.org/unsd/unsystem/Documents/QAF-UNIDO.pdf">The
  UNIDO Quality Assurance Framework</a> is followed to ensure that the
  statistical activities of UNIDO are relevant and the data compiled and
  disseminated are accurate, complete within the defined scope and coverage,
  timely, comparable in terms of internationally recommended methods and
  classification standards and internally coherent to variables included in the
  datasets. While these generally accepted, broad dimensions of quality of
  statistical data may be defined in each NSO&apos;s own quality assurance
  framework. UNIDO makes maximum effort that data produced from the statistical
  operation undertaken with the UNIDO technical cooperation are accurate,
  internationally comparable and coherent.</p>
QUALITY_ASSMNT: >-
  <p>The National Accounts Section of the UNSD and UNIDO employ a wide range of
  data quality techniques and consultations with national providers to assure
  quality principles supported by the Fundamental Principles of Official
  Statistics. </p>

  <p><strong>Disaggregation:</strong></p>

  <p>No disaggregation available.</p>
COMPARABILITY: >-
  <p><strong>Sources of discrepancies: </strong>Minor differences may arise due
  to 1) exchange rates for conversion to USD 2) different base years used for
