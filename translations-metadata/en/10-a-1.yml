  <p><strong>Definition:</strong></p>

  <p>Proportion of total number of tariff lines (in per cent) applied to
  products imported from least developed countries and developing countries
  corresponding to a 0% tariff rate in HS chapter 01-97.</p>

  <p><strong>Concepts:</strong></p>

  <p>Tariff line or National Tariff lines (NTL): National Tariff Line codes
  refer to the classification codes, applied to merchandise goods by individual
  countries, that are longer than the HS six digit level. Countries are free to
  introduce national distinctions for tariffs and many other purposes. The
  national tariff line codes are based on the HS system but are longer than six
  digits. For example, the six digit HS code 010120 refers to Asses, mules and
  hinnies, live, whereas the US National Tariff line code 010120.10 refers to
  live purebred breeding asses, 010120.20 refers to live asses other than
  purebred breeding asses and 010120.30 refers to mules and hinnies imported for
  immediate slaughter.</p>

  <p>Tariffs: Tariffs are customs duties on merchandise imports, levied either
  on an ad valorem basis (percentage of value) or on a specific basis (e.g. $7
  per 100 kg). Tariffs can be used to create a price advantage for similar
  locally-produced goods and for raising government revenues. Trade remedy
  measures and taxes are not considered to be tariffs.</p>

  <p>The main information used to calculate indicators 10.a.1 is import tariff
  data. Information on import tariffs might be retrieved by contacting directly
  National statistical offices, permanent country missions to the UN, regional
  organizations or focal points within the customs, ministries in charge of
  customs revenues (Ministry of economy/finance and related revenue authorities)
  or, alternatively, the Ministry of trade. Tariff data for the calculation of
  this indicator are retrieved from ITC (MAcMap) - http://www.macmap.org/ - WTO
  (IDB) - http://tao.wto.org - and UNCTAD (TRAINS) databases. Import tariff data
  included in the ITC (MAcMap) database are collected by contacting directly
  focal points in line national agencies or regional organizations (in the case
  of custom unions or regional economic communities). When available, data are
  downloaded from national or regional official websites. In some cases, data
  are purchased from private companies. Import tariff data included in the WTO
  (IDB) database are sourced from official notifications of WTO members. Import
  tariff included in the UNCTAD (TRAINS) database are collected from official
  sources, including official country or regional organizations websites.</p>
FREQ_COLL: <p>Continuously updated all year round</p>
REL_CAL_POLICY: >-
  <p>Indicatively the indicators calculations can be ready by March every year.
  However, the date of release will depend on the period envisaged for the

RATIONALE: >-
  <p>The calculation of this indicator will allow observing on how many products
  Developing countries and LDCs will have free access to Developed countries
  markets. When compared to the tariff rates applied to other countries, this
  indicator will allow assessing to which extent special and differential
  treatment has been accorded in terms of import tariffs. The evolution of this
  indicator will indicate progress on the phasing out of tariff rates on goods
  coming from Developing and LDCs.</p>
REC_USE_LIM: >-
  <p>&quot;The following caveats should be taken in consideration while
  reviewing this indicator:</p>

  <p>Accurate estimates on special and differential treatment for developing
  countries do not exist, thus the calculations are limited to tariffs only.
  These are only part of the trade limitation factors, especially when looking
  at exports of developing or least developed countries under non-reciprocal
  preferential treatment that set criteria for eligibility.</p>

  <p>A full coverage of preferential schemes of developed countries are used for
  the computation, but preferential treatment may not be fully used by
  developing countries&apos; exporters for different reasons such as the
  inability of certain exporters to meet eligibility criteria (i.e., complying
  with rules of origin). As there is no accurate statistical information on the
  extent of the actual utilisation of each of these preferences, it is assumed
  that they are fully utilised.</p>

  <p>Duty free treatment is an indicator of market access, but is not always
  synonymous with preferential treatment for beneficiary countries, because a
  number of MFN tariffs are already at, or close to, zero, especially for fuels
  and minerals. International agreements on IT products also offer duty-free
  treatment for components and equipment used for production purpose&quot;</p>
