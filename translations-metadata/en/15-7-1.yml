  <p><strong>Definition:</strong></p>

  <p>The share of all trade in wildlife detected as being illegal</p>

  <p><strong>Concepts:</strong></p>

  <p>&#x201C;All trade in wildlife&#x201D; is the sum of the values of legal and
  illegal trade</p>

  <p>&#x201C;Legal trade&#x201D; is the sum of the value of all shipments made
  in compliance with the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species
  of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), using valid CITES permits and
  certificates.</p>

  <p>&#x201C;Illegal trade&#x201D; is the sum of the value of all CITES/listed
  specimens seized.</p>
SOURCE_TYPE: >-
  <p>The legal trade data are reported annually by Parties to CITES and stored
  in the CITES Trade Database, managed by the UNEP World Conservation Monitoring
  Centre in Cambridge.</p>

  <p>The detected illegal trade data have been gathered from a number of sources
  and combined in a UNODC database called &#x201C;World WISE&#x201D;. This
  database will be filled, from 2017, with data from the new annual CITES
  Illegal Trade reporting requirement.</p>

  <p>The US LEMIS price data for CITES-listed species are also provided to
  UNEP-WCMC within the U.S. annual report to CITES.</p>
COLL_METHOD: >-
  <p>Some adjustment/validation is necessary between countries, but standardized
  codes for the legal wildlife trade have been developing since 1975. The basic
  fields necessary for the global indicator (species, product, and unit) are
  well established and present in every seizure. Some unit conversions (e.g.
  logs to MT to m3 for timber) are necessary for some products. For many
  commodities, for instance trade in live animals and trophies, it is possible
  to aggregate based on &#x201C;whole individuals&#x201D;. To do regional or
  national breakdowns, however, data on the source of the shipment are necessary
  (as the impact of poaching pertains to the source country, not the seizure
  country), and these data are not available for every seizure.</p>
FREQ_COLL: >-
  <p>The first tranche of data from the Illicit Trade Report should be available
  in November 2017. </p>
REL_CAL_POLICY: <p>To be determined</p>
DATA_SOURCE: <p>The CITES Management Authority of each country</p>
COMPILING_ORG: <p>UNODC and UNEP-WCMC</p>
RATIONALE: >-
  <p><strong>Rationale:</strong></p>

  <p>There are over 35,000 species under international protection, so it is
  impossible to monitor all poaching. Illegal trade, however, is an indirect
  indicator of poaching. Wildlife seizures represent concrete instances of
  illegal trade, but the share of overall wildlife crime they represent is
  unknown and variable. In addition, the number of species under international
  protection continues to grow. Legal international trade in protected species,
  by definition, is 100% captured in the CITES Trade Database, which now
  contains over 16 million records of trade in CITES-listed species. To ground
  the illegal trade data in a complete indicator, the ratio of aggregated
  seizures to total trade is estimated. An increase in the share of total
  wildlife trade that is illegal would be interpreted as a negative indicator,
  and a decrease as a positive one.</p>

  <p>Because the illegal wildlife trade represents thousands of distinct
  products, a means of aggregation is necessary. The legal trade value does not
  represent the true black market value of the items seized, nor the true value
  of the legal shipments, because it is derived from a single market source (US
  LEMIS). It does, however, present a logical and consistent means of
  aggregating unlike products.</p>
REC_USE_LIM: >-
  <p>Seizures are an incomplete indicator of trafficking, and subject to
  considerable volatility. Universal coverage is not presently available,
  although 120 countries are represented in the present database. Since the
  indicator looks at the relationship between two values, changes in the
  relationship could be due to changes in either value.</p>
DATA_COMP: >-
  <p>The value of a species-product unit is derived from the weighted average of
  prices declared for legal imports of analogous species product units, as
  acquired from United States Law Enforcement Monitoring and Information System
  of the Fish and Wildlife Service.</p>

  <p>The value of legal trade is the sum of all species-product units documented
  in CITES export permits as reported in the CITES Annual Reports times the
  species-product unit prices as specified above.</p>

  <p>The value of illegal trade is the sum of all species-product units
  documented in the World WISE seizure database times the species-product unit
  prices as specified above.</p>

  <p>The indicator is value of illegal trade/(value of legal trade + value of
  illegal trade)</p>
IMPUTATION: >-
  <ul>
    <li><strong>At country level</strong></li>
  </ul>

  <p>Given the number of products and volatility of these markets, there is
  presently no mechanism for imputing missing data.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>At regional and global levels</strong></li>
  </ul>

  <p>As above</p>
REG_AGG: <p>National data are added.</p>
COVERAGE: >-
  <p><strong>Data availability:</strong></p>

  <p>60</p>

  <p><strong>Time series:</strong></p>

  <p><strong>Disaggregation:</strong></p>

  <p>Where source data are available, the data could be disaggregated to the
  national level. As a form of trade data, issues of gender, age, and disability
  status are not applicable.</p>
COMPARABILITY: >-
  <p><strong>Sources of discrepancies:</strong></p>

  <p>The global figure is the aggregate of national figures provided by
  countries.</p>
