  <p><strong>Definition:</strong></p>

  <p>The mortality attributable to the joint effects of household and ambient
  air pollution can be expressed as: Number of deaths, Death rate. Death rates
  are calculated by dividing the number of deaths by the total population (or
  indicated if a different population group is used, e.g. children under 5
  years).</p>

  <p>Evidence from epidemiological studies have shown that exposure to air
  pollution is linked, among others, to the important diseases taken into
  account in this estimate:</p>

  <p>- Acute respiratory infections (estimated in all age groups);</p>

  <p>- Cerebrovascular diseases (stroke) in adults (estimated above 25
  years);</p>

  <p>- Ischaemic heart diseases (IHD) in adults (estimated above 25 years);</p>

  <p>- Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in adults (estimated above
  25 years); and</p>

  <p>- Lung cancer in adults (estimated above 25 years).</p>

  <p><strong>Concepts:</strong></p>

  <p>The mortality resulting from exposure to ambient (outdoor) air pollution
  and household (indoor) air pollution from polluting fuels use for cooking was
  assessed. Ambient air pollution results from emissions from industrial
  activity, households, cars and trucks which are complex mixtures of air
  pollutants, many of which are harmful to health. Of all of these pollutants,
  fine particulate matter has the greatest effect on human health. By polluting
  fuels is understood kerosene, wood, coal, animal dung, charcoal, and crop
  wastes.</p>

  <p>Exposure: Indicator 7.1.2 was used as exposure indicator for household air

  <p>Annual mean concentration of particulate matter of less than 2.5 um was

  according to methods described for Indicator 11.6.2.</p>

  epidemiological evidence identified through a systematic search of studies on
  particulate matter and mortality for the five outcomes of interest.</p>

RATIONALE: >-
  <p>As part of a broader project to assess major risk factors to health, the
  mortality resulting from exposure to ambient (outdoor) air pollution and
  household (indoor) air pollution from polluting fuel use for cooking was
  assessed. Ambient air pollution results from emissions from industrial
  activity, households, cars and trucks which are complex mixtures of air
  pollutants, many of which are harmful to health. Of all of these pollutants,
  fine particulate matter has the greatest effect on human health. By polluting
  fuels is understood as wood, coal, animal dung, charcoal, and crop wastes, as
  well as kerosene.</p>

  <p>Air pollution is the biggest environmental risk to health. The majority of
  the burden is borne by the populations in low and middle-income countries.</p>
REC_USE_LIM: >-
  <p>An approximation of the combined effects of risk factors is possible if
  independence and little correlation between risk factors with impacts on the
  same diseases can be assumed (Ezzati et al, 2003). In the case of air
  pollution, however, there are some limitations to estimate the joint effects:
  limited knowledge on the distribution of the population exposed to both
  household and ambient air pollution, correlation of exposures at individual
  level as household air pollution is a contributor to ambient air pollution,
  and non-linear interactions (Lim et al, 2012; Smith et al, 2014). In several
  regions, however, household air pollution remains mainly a rural issue, while
  ambient air pollution is predominantly an urban problem. Also, in some
  continents, many countries are relatively unaffected by household air
  pollution, while ambient air pollution is a major concern. If assuming
  independence and little correlation, a rough estimate of the total impact can
  be calculated, which is less than the sum of the impact of the two risk
  factors.</p>
DATA_COMP: >-
  <p>Attributable mortality is calculated by first combining information on the
  increased (or relative) risk of a disease resulting from exposure, with
  information on how widespread the exposure is in the population (e.g. the
  annual mean concentration of particulate matter to which the population is
  exposed, proportion of population relying primarily on polluting fuels for
  cooking).</p>

  <p>This allows calculation of the &apos;population attributable fraction&apos;
  (PAF), which is the fraction of disease seen in a given population that can be
  attributed to the exposure (e.g in that case of both the annual mean
  concentration of particulate matter and exposure to polluting fuels for
  cooking).</p>

  <p>Applying this fraction to the total burden of disease (e.g. cardiopulmonary
  disease expressed as deaths), gives the total number of deaths that results
  from exposure to that particular risk factor (in the example given above, to
  ambient and household air pollution).</p>

  <p>To estimate the combined effects of risk factors, a joint population
  attributable fraction is calculated, as described in Ezzati et al (2003).</p>

  <p>The mortality associated with household and ambient air pollution was
  estimated based on the calculation of the joint population attributable
  fractions assuming independently distributed exposures and independent hazards
  as described in (Ezzati et al, 2003).</p>

  <p>The joint population attributable fraction (PAF) were calculated using the
  following formula:</p>

  <p>PAF=1-PRODUCT (1-PAFi)</p>

  <p>Where PAFi is PAF of individual risk factors.</p>

  <p>The PAF for ambient air pollution and the PAF for household air pollution
  were assessed separately, based on the Comparative Risk Assessment (Ezzati et
  al, 2002) and expert groups for the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2010 study
  (Lim et al, 2012; Smith et al, 2014).</p>

  <p>For exposure to ambient air pollution, annual mean estimates of particulate
  matter of a diameter of less than 2.5 um (PM25) were modelled as described in
  (WHO 2016, forthcoming), or for Indicator 11.6.2.</p>

  <p>For exposure to household air pollution, the proportion of population with
  primary reliance on polluting fuels use for cooking was modelled (see
  Indicator 7.1.2 [polluting fuels use=1-clean fuels use]). Details on the model
  are published in (Bonjour et al, 2013).</p>

  <p>The integrated exposure-response functions (IER) developed for the GBD 2010
  and 2013 (Burnett et al, 2014 and Forouzanfar et al, 2015) were used. These
  IERs were updated using the most recent epidemiological evidence identified
  through a systematic search of studies on particulate matter and mortality for
  the five outcomes of interest.</p>

  <p>The percentage of the population exposed to a specific risk factor (here
  ambient air pollution, i.e. PM2.5) was provided by country and by increment of
  1 &#xB5;g/m3; relative risks were calculated for each PM2.5 increment, based
  on the IER. The counterfactual concentration was selected to be between 2.4
  and 5.9 &#xB5;g/m3, as described elsewhere ( Cohen et al, 2017). The country
  population attributable fraction for ALRI, COPD, IHD, stroke and lung cancer
  were calculated using the following formula : </p>

  <p>PAF=SUM(Pi(RR-1)/(SUM(RR-1)+1)</p>

  <p>Where i is the level of PM2.5 in ug/m3, and Pi is the percentage of the
  population exposed to that level of air pollution, and RR is the relative
  risk.</p>

  <p>The calculations for household air pollution are similar, and are explained
  in detailed elsewhere (WHO 2014a).</p>
