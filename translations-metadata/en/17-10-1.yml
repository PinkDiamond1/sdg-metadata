  <p><strong>Definition:</strong></p>

  <p>Value in percentage of weighted average tariffs applied to the imports of
  goods in HS chapter 01-97.</p>

  <p><strong>Concepts:</strong></p>

  <p>Weighted average: In order to aggregate tariff value for country groups it
  is recommended to make use of a weighting methodology based on the value of
  goods imported.</p>

  <p>Tariffs: Tariffs are customs duties on merchandise imports, levied either
  on an ad valorem basis (percentage of value) or on a specific basis (e.g. $7
  per 100 kg). Tariffs can be used to create a price advantage for similar
  locally-produced goods and for raising government revenues. Trade remedy
  measures and taxes are not considered to be tariffs.</p>
SOURCE_TYPE: >-
  <p>The main information used to calculate indicators 17.10.1 is import tariff
  data. Information on import tariffs might be retrieved by contacting directly
  National statistical offices, permanent country missions to the UN, regional
  organizations or focal points within the customs, ministries in charge of
  customs revenues (Ministry of economy/finance and related revenue authorities)
  or, alternatively, the Ministry of trade. Tariff data for the calculation of
  this indicator are retrieved from ITC (MAcMap) - http://www.macmap.org/ - WTO
  (IDB) - http://tao.wto.org - and UNCTAD (TRAINS) databases. Import tariff data
  included in the ITC (MAcMap) database are collected by contacting directly
  focal points in line national agencies or regional organizations (in the case
  of custom unions or regional economic communities). When available, data are
  downloaded from national or regional official websites. In some cases, data
  are purchased from private companies. Import tariff data included in the WTO
  (IDB) database are sourced from official notifications of WTO members. Import
  tariff included in the UNCTAD (TRAINS) database are collected from official
  sources, including official country or regional organizations websites.</p>
FREQ_COLL: <p>Continuously update all year round</p>
REL_CAL_POLICY: >-
  <p>Indicatively the indicators calculations can be ready by March every year.
  However, the date of release will depend on the period envisaged for the
  launching of the SDG monitoring report.</p>
COMPILING_ORG: '<p>ITC, WTO and UNCTAD will jointly report on this indicator</p>'
RATIONALE: >-
  <p>The average level of customs tariff rates applied worldwide can be used as
  an indicator of the degree of success achieved by multilateral negotiations
  and regional trade agreements.</p>
REC_USE_LIM: >-
  <p>Tariffs are only part of the factors that can explain the degree of
  openness and transparency in the international trade arena. However, accurate
  estimates on non-tariff measures or of transparency indicator do not
  exist.</p>

  <p>To further refine the quality of the information, additional
  sub-measurements could be calculated including: a) Tariff peaks (i.e. % of
  tariffs on some products that are considerably higher than usual, defined as
  above 15 per cent) and b) Tariff escalation (i.e. wherein a country applies a
  higher tariff rate to products at the later stages of production). These
  calculations were already provided by ITC as part of the MDG Gap Task Force
  Report. See the report for further information on the methodology at
  http://www.un.org/en/development/desa/policy/mdg_gap/mdg_gap2014/2014GAP_FULL_EN.pdf</p>
DATA_COMP: >-
  <p>In order to include all tariffs into the calculation, some rates which are
  not expressed in ad valorem form (e.g., specific duties) are converted in ad
  valorem equivalents (i.e. in per cent of the import value), The conversion is
  made at the tariff line level for each importer by using the unit value
  method. Import unit values are calculated from import values and quantities.
  Only a limited number of non-ad valorem tariff rates (i.e. technical duties)
  cannot be provided with ad valorem equivalents (AVE) and are excluded from the
  calculation. This methodology also allows for cross-country comparisons.</p>
