  <p>Definitions:</p>

  <p>The indicator includes hazardous generated, hazardous waste generated by
  type (including e-waste as a sub-indicator) and the proportion of hazardous
  waste treated. For the e-waste sub-category, United Nations University is a
  co-custodian.</p>

  <p><strong>Hazardous waste generated (in tonnes, per km sq of land area and
  per capita)</strong>: Hazardous waste collected + Hazardous waste given by
  generator to treatment or disposal facilities + Estimation of Unaccounted for
  hazardous waste</p>

  <p><strong>Hazardous waste generated by type, including e-waste</strong>: A
  breakdown of hazardous waste generated by key type of waste, including
  e-waste</p>

  <p><strong>Proportion of hazardous waste treated</strong>: Quantity of
  hazardous waste treated during reporting year/quantity of hazardous waste
  generated x 100</p>

  <p>A full methodology for this indicator is available in the document
  entitled, &#x201C;Global Chemicals and Waste Indicator Review Document (UNEP,
  forthcoming)&#x201D;.</p>

  <p>Concepts:</p>

  <p><em>Hazardous waste</em> is waste with properties that make it hazardous or
  capable of having a harmful effect on human health or the environment.
  Hazardous waste is generated from many sources, ranging from industrial
  manufacturing process waste to domestic items such as batteries and may come
  in many forms, including liquids, solids, gases and sludge. They can be
  discarded as commercial products, like cleaning fluids or pesticides or the
  by-products of manufacturing processes, from Basel Convention (Article 1,
  paragraph 1(a)). Waste listed in Annex VIII of the Basel Convention is
  presumed to be hazardous, while waste listed in Annex IX is presumed not to be
  hazardous. For the purpose of this indicator, due to comparability reasons,
  additional waste considered hazardous as per national definitions, as provided
  by the Basel Convention under Article 1, paragraph 1 (b), are excluded.</p>

  <p><em>Hazardous waste generated</em> refers to the quantity of hazardous
  waste (as per the definition above) that is generated within the country
  during the reported year, prior to any activity such as collection,
  preparation for reuse, treatment, recovery, including recycling, or export, no
  matter the destination of this waste. In case waste that are not covered under
  the above definition, but are defined as, or are considered to be hazardous
  waste by national definitions are included in the &#x201C;hazardous waste
  generated&#x201D; amount, a specific note should be added specifying the
  additional types/streams of hazardous waste included as well as their
  quantities. </p>

  <p>The hazardous waste generated should be reported as a total amount
  generated during the year, as well as by its distribution among wide
  categories of economic activities and by households. The economic included in
  the scope of hazardous waste:</p>

  <p>&#x2022; Agriculture, forestry and fishing (ISIC 01-03)</p>

  <p>&#x2022; Mining and quarrying (ISIC 05-09)</p>

  <p>&#x2022; Manufacturing (ISIC 10-33)</p>

  <p>&#x2022; Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply (ISIC 35)</p>

  <p>&#x2022; Construction (ISIC 41-43)</p>

  <p>&#x2022; Other economic activities excluding ISIC 38</p>

  <p>As not all hazardous waste generated is immediately treated or disposed of,
  the stock of hazardous waste should also be reported, as per the categories
  and indications in Table R2 of the UNSD/UNEP Questionnaire (waste
  section).</p>

RATIONALE: >-
  <p>Chemicals are part of everyday life. There are over 140,000 different
  substances used in all economic sectors globally. Their benefits are many and
  so too are their potential to adversely impact human health and the
  environment if not properly managed. All countries, but especially developing
  countries and economies in transition, are facing the complex challenge of
  managing hazardous waste according to international standards of good
  practice. The situation is complicated by limited human, financial and/or
  technical resources. As such, action is needed to support the sustainable use
  of chemicals and environmentally sound management of hazardous waste. There is
  also a rapid increase in the generation of hazardous waste. Where most of the
  conventional hazardous wastes are produced in industrial and manufacturing
  operations, significant amounts are generated in non-industrial sectors,
  including sludge from the healthcare sector; waste-water treatment plants,
  waste oils, and waste batteries. There is also an increase in the complexity
  of products and unidentified hazardous components like coatings, and/or items
  which are not hazardous (laminates and multi-layer packaging), but present
  hazardousness in a variety of ways when improperly discarded and end up in
  air, water or are burned.</p>
REC_USE_LIM: >-
  <p>Data on hazardous waste generation and treatment may be scarce in some
  countries, due to a series of factors, such as lack of, or insufficient,
  policies and regulations on management and/or reporting; limited human,
  financial and technical resources within government agencies, lack of clear
  disclosure and reporting rules and requirements, and unwillingness of
  generators and public officials in certain countries to disclose the
  quantities of hazardous waste generated. Some countries may have the data and
  monitoring systems needed to report, while for others there is a need for
  training and capacity development to enhance data collection, validation and
  reporting capacity. </p>

  <p>Limitations in terms of usable data for calculating the indicator(s) may
  arise due to differences in the way of understanding the terminology used in
  the indicator or differences between these definitions and the definitions
  included in national legislation. This can lead to differences in reported
  values and difficulties in cross-checking of reported data. For example, by
  national legislation, countries may define additional types of waste to be
  considered as hazardous beyond the waste streams defined in the Basel
  Convention.</p>
DATA_COMP: >-
  <p>A full methodology for this indicator is available in the document
  entitled, &#x201C;Global Chemicals and Waste Indicator Review Document (UNEP,
  forthcoming)&#x201D;.</p>

  <p>For the purpose of this indicator, </p>

  <p>Hazardous waste generated should include collected hazardous waste (either
  by specialized companies or by municipal services), hazardous waste which is
  given by the generator directly to the treatment or disposal facility, as well
  as an estimation of the hazardous waste which is unaccounted for. Generated
  hazardous waste includes exported hazardous waste and excludes imports of
  hazardous waste.</p>

  <p>The estimation of hazardous waste unaccounted for is the most difficult
  aspect of this methodology as it requires local-level knowledge and
  estimation. This aspect of the indicator is particularly important as
  hazardous waste that is unaccounted for is typically also untreated and has a
  high potential to impact the environment.</p>

  <p>The proportion of hazardous waste treated is presented below. Note that the
  total quantity of hazardous waste treated during the reported year in the
  reporting country is calculated by adding quantities of hazardous waste
  treated, per each type of treatment (recycling, incineration with/without
  energy recovery, landfilling or other), including exports and excluding
  imports. This matches with the definition of recycling in 12.5.1.</p>

  <p>* Hazardous waste treated in the country plus materials exported for
  treatment minus the materials imported for treatment. </p>
DATA_VALIDATION: >-
  <p>UNSD carries out extensive data validation procedures that include built-in
  automated procedures, manual checks and cross-references to national sources
  of data. Communication is carried out with countries for clarification and
  validation of data. Only data that are considered accurate or those confirmed
  by countries during the validation process are included in UNSD&#x2019;s
  environment statistics database and disseminated on UNSD&#x2019;s website</p>
IMPUTATION: >-
  <p>UNSD, who conducts the data collection, validation and dissemination
  process via the UNSD/UNEP Questionnaire on Environment Statistics, does not
  make any estimation or imputation for missing values so the number of data
  points provided are actual country data. </p>

  <p>However, UNEP is considering the possibility of global modelling. </p>
REG_AGG: >-
  <p>The data will be aggregated at the sub-regional, regional and global
  levels. For the aggregation methods, please see: <a
  href="http://wesr.unep.org/media/docs/graphs/aggregation_methods.pdf">http://wesr.unep.org/media/docs/graphs/aggregation_methods.pdf</a>.

COVERAGE: >-
  <p>Data availability:</p>

  <p>All countries that reply to the questionnaire.</p>

  <p>Time series:</p>

  <p>The UNSD/UNEP Questionnaire on Environment Statistics is sent every 2 years
  requesting annual data and the time series will be maintained.</p>

  <p>Disaggregation: </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Disaggregation by ISIC codes. Information on the generation and treatment of hazardous waste could be collected from industry or municipal level and treatment/disposal facilities. </li>
    <li>Disaggregation by type of landfilling. As there is a significant difference between landfilling in controlled and uncontrolled landfills, further disaggregation on this type of treatment could be analysed.</li>
    <li>Disaggregation by type of treatment per each generating sector; </li>
    <li>Disaggregation by type of recycling operation (R2 to R12 from Basel convention Annex IV).</li>
    <li>Disaggregation by territorial division. Information on the hazardous waste generated can significantly vary throughout the territory of a country as there might be hotspots of hazardous waste generation, concentrated around industry intensive areas. </li>
  </ul>
COMPARABILITY: >-
  <p>Sources of discrepancies:</p>

  <p>As mentioned, waste statistics involve a large number of national and
  sub-national stakeholders which may create discrepancies. To address these
  possible discrepancies, inter-institutional stakeholder collaboration is
  always encouraged.</p>
