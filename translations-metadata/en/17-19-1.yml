  <p><strong>Definition:</strong></p>

  <p>The indicator Dollar value of all resources made available to strengthen
  statistical capacity in developing countries is based on the Partner Report on
  Support to Statistics (PRESS) that is designed and administered by PARIS21 to
  provide a snapshot of the US dollar value of ongoing statistical support in
  developing countries.</p>
SOURCE_TYPE: >-
  <p>To provide a full picture of international support to statistics, the
  indicator draws on three distinct data sources. The first source of data is
  the OECD Creditor Reporting System (CRS), which records data from OECD
  Development Assistance Committee (DAC) members and some non-DAC donors, and
  provides a comprehensive accounting of ODA. Donors report specific codes for
  the sector targeted by their aid activity. Statistical capacity building (SCB)
  is designated by code 16062. </p>

  <p>Second, when SCB is a component of a larger project, it is not identified
  by this code, causing the CRS figures to underestimate actual levels of
  support for international aid. PARIS21 seeks to reduce this downward bias by
  searching project descriptions in the CRS for terms indicating a component of
  SCB. The methodology is presented at http://www.paris21.org/PRESS2015.</p>

  <p>Third, and finally, the PARIS21 Secretariat supplements this data with an
  online questionnaire completed by a global network of reporters. The
  questionnaire covers a subset of the variables collected in the CRS and some
  additional variables specific to statistical capacity building. Reporting to
  the questionnaire is voluntary, offering an opportunity for actors to share
  information on their statistical activities. Reporters to this questionnaire
  are countries that do not report to the CRS, as well as multilateral
  institutions with large portfolios of statistical projects that have requested
  to report to the PARIS21 Secretariat directly.</p>

  <p>Measuring support to statistics comes with many methodological challenges.
  The financial figures presented in the PRESS therefore need to be interpreted
  with these challenges in mind. For instance, PRESS numbers rely on the
  Creditor Reporting System (CRS) for ODA commitments supplemented by voluntary
  reporting from additional donors. Yet, full coverage of all programs cannot be
  guaranteed. Furthermore, the reported commitments can be seen as an upper
  bound to the actual support to statistics for mainly three reasons. First,
  double counting of projects may occur when the donor and project implementer
  report on the same project or when all project co-financers report project
  totals. Second, the reported numbers may be inflated by working with project
  totals for multi-sector projects, which comprise only a small statistics
  component. Finally, the PRESS reports on donor-side commitments which do not
  always translate to actual disbursements to the recipient countries.</p>

  <p>The indicator only captures international support to statistics and does
  not account for domestic resources.</p>
DATA_COMP: >-
  <p>The financial amounts were converted to US dollars by using the period
  average exchange rate of the commitment year of the project/program. In cases
  where the disbursement amounts were reported, the exchange rate used was the
  period average of the disbursement year.</p>
