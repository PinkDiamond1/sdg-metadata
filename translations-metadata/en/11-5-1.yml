  <p><strong>Definition:</strong></p>

  <p>This indicator measures the number of people who died, went missing or were
  directly affected by disasters per 100,000 population. </p>

  <p><strong>Concepts:</strong></p>

  <p>Death: The number of people who died during the disaster, or directly
  after, as a direct result of the hazardous event.</p>

  <p>Missing: The number of people whose whereabouts is unknown since the
  hazardous event. It includes people who are presumed dead, for whom there is
  no physical evidence such as a body, and for which an official/legal report
  has been filed with competent authorities.</p>

  <p>Directly affected: The number of people who have suffered injury, illness
  or other health effects; who were evacuated, displaced, relocated or have
  suffered direct damage to their livelihoods, economic, physical, social,
  cultural and environmental assets. Indirectly affected are people who have
  suffered consequences, other than or in addition to direct effects, over time,
  due to disruption or changes in economy, critical infrastructure, basic
  services, commerce or work, or social, health and psychological
  consequences.</p>
SOURCE_TYPE: >-
  <p><strong>Data sources and collection method:</strong></p>

  <p>Data provider at national level is appointed Sendai Framework Focal Points.
  In most countries disaster data are collected by line ministries and national
  disaster loss databases are established and managed by special purpose
  agencies including national disaster management agencies, civil protection
  agencies, and meteorological agencies. The Sendai Framework Focal Points in
  each country are responsible of data reporting through the Sendai Framework
  Monitoring System.</p>
RATIONALE: >-
  <p>The Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030 was adopted by
  UN Member States in March 2015 as a global policy of disaster risk reduction.
  Among the global targets, &#x201C;Target A: Substantially reduce global
  disaster mortality by 2030, aiming to lower average per 100,000 global
  mortality between 2020-2030 compared with 2005-2015&#x201D; and &#x201C;Target
  B: Substantially reduce the number of affected people globally by 2030, aiming
  to lower the average global figure per 100,000 between 2020-2030 compared with
  2005-2015&#x201D; will contribute to sustainable development and strengthen
  economic, social, health and environmental resilience. The economic,
  environmental and social perspectives would include poverty eradication, urban
  resilience, and climate change adaptation.</p>

  <p>The open-ended intergovernmental expert working group on indicators and
  terminology relating to disaster risk reduction (OIEWG) established by the
  General Assembly (resolution 69/284) has developed a set of indicators to
  measure global progress in the implementation of the Sendai Framework, which
  was endorsed by the UNGA (OIEWG report A/71/644). The relevant global
  indicators for the Sendai Framework will be used to report for this indicator.
  </p>

  <p>Disaster loss data is greatly influenced by large-scale catastrophic
  events, which represent important outliers. UNISDR recommends countries report
  the data by event, so that complementary analysis can be undertaken to obtain
  trends and patterns in which such catastrophic events (that can represent
  outliers) can be included or excluded.</p>
REC_USE_LIM: >-
  <p>The Sendai Framework Monitoring System has been developed to measure the
  progress in the implementation of the Sendai Framework by UNGA endorsed
  indicators. Member States will be able to report through the System from March
  2018. The data for SDG indicators will be compiled and reported by UNISDR.</p>

  <p>Proxy, alternative and additional indicators:</p>

  <p>In most cases international data sources only record events that surpass
  some threshold of impact and use secondary data sources which usually have non
  uniform or even inconsistent methodologies, producing heterogeneous
  datasets.</p>
