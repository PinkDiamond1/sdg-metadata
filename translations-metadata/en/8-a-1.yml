  <p><strong>Definition:</strong> </p>

  <p>Aid for Trade commitments and disbursements is the gross disbursements and
  commitments of total Official Development Assistance (ODA) from all donors for
  aid for trade. </p>

  <p> </p>

  <p><strong>Concepts:</strong> </p>

  <p>The DAC defines Official Development Assistance (ODA) as &#x201C;those
  flows to countries and territories on the DAC List of ODA Recipients and to
  multilateral institutions which are i) provided by official agencies,
  including state and local governments, or by their executive agencies; and ii)
  each transaction is administered with the promotion of the economic
  development and welfare of developing countries as its main objective; and is
  concessional in character and conveys a grant element of at least 25 per cent
  (calculated at a rate of discount of 10 per cent). (See
  http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/officialdevelopmentassistancedefinitionandcoverage.htm)
  </p>

  <p> </p>

  <p>Other official flows (OOF),excluding officially supported export credits,
  are defined as transactions by the official sector which do not meet the
  conditions for eligibility as ODA, either because they are not primarily aimed
  at development, or because they are not sufficiently concessional. See
  http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/documentupload/DCDDAC(2016)3FINAL.pdf, Para 24.
  </p>

  <p> </p>

  <p>Aid for Trade is captured in the CRS through sector codes in the 331 series
  and the aid for trade marker. see here:
  http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/purposecodessectorclassification.htm. </p>

  <p> </p>

  <p>&#x2018;All donors&#x2019; refers to DAC donors, non-DAC donors and
  multilateral organisations. </p>

  <p> </p>
SOURCE_TYPE: >-
  <p>The OECD/DAC has been collecting data on official and private resource
  flows from 1960 at an aggregate level and 1973 at an activity level through
  the Creditor Reporting System (CRS data are considered complete from 1995 for
  commitments at an activity level and 2002 for disbursements). </p>

  <p> </p>

  <p>The data are reported by donors according to the same standards and
  methodologies (see here: http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/methodology.htm). </p>

  <p> </p>

  <p>Data are reported on an annual calendar year basis by statistical reporters
  in national administrations (aid agencies, Ministries of Foreign Affairs or
  Finance, etc. </p>
COLL_METHOD: >-
  <p>A statistical reporter is responsible for the collection of DAC statistics
  in each providing country/agency. This reporter is usually located in the
  national aid agency, Ministry of Foreign Affairs or Finance etc. </p>
FREQ_COLL: >-
  <p>Data are published on an annual basis in December for flows in the previous
  year. Detailed 2015 flows will be published in December 2016. </p>
REL_CAL_POLICY: <p>December 2016. </p>

COMPILING_ORG: <p>OECD </p>
RATIONALE: >-
  <p> Total Official Development Assistance (ODA) and Other Official Flows (OOF)
  to developing countries quantify the public effort that donors provide to
  developing countries for aid for trade. </p>

  <p> </p>
REC_USE_LIM: >-
  <p>Data in the Creditor Reporting System are available from 1973. However, the
  data coverage is considered complete from 1995 for commitments at an activity
  level and 2002 for disbursements. </p>

  <p> </p>
DATA_COMP: >-
  <p>The sum of ODA and OOF flows from all donors to developing countries for
  aid for trade. </p>
IMPUTATION: >-
  <ul>
    <li><strong>At country level </strong></li>
  </ul>

  <p> </p>

  <p>Due to high quality of reporting, no estimates are produced for missing
  data. </p>

  <p> </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>At regional and global levels </strong></li>
  </ul>

  <p> </p>

  <p>Not applicable. </p>
REG_AGG: >-
  <p>Global and regional figures are based on the sum of ODA and OOF flows for
  aid for trade activities. </p>
COVERAGE: >-
  <p><strong>Data availability:</strong></p>

  <p>On a donor basis for all DAC countries and many non-DAC providers
  (bilateral and multilateral) that report to the DAC on aid for scholarships.
  </p>

  <p>On a recipient basis for all developing countries eligible for ODA. </p>

  <p><strong>Disaggregation:</strong></p>

  <p>This indicator can be disaggregated by donor, recipient country, type of
  finance, type of aid, trade policy and regulations and trade related
  adjustment sub-sectors, etc.. </p>

  <p> </p>
COMPARABILITY: >-
  <p><strong>Sources of discrepancies:</strong></p>

  <p>DAC statistics are standardized on a calendar year basis for all donors and
  may differ from fiscal year data available in budget documents for some
  countries. </p>
