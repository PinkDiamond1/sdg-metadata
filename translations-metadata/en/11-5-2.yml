  <p><strong>Definition:</strong></p>

  <p>This indicator measures the ratio of direct economic loss attributed to
  disasters in relation to GDP.</p>

  <p><strong>Concepts:</strong></p>

  <p>Economic Loss: Total economic impact that consists of direct economic loss
  and indirect economic loss.</p>

  <p>Direct economic loss: the monetary value of total or partial destruction of
  physical assets existing in the affected area. Direct economic loss is nearly
  equivalent to physical damage.</p>

  <p>Indirect economic loss: a decline in economic value added as a consequence
  of direct economic loss and/or human and environmental impacts.</p>

  <p><em>Annotations: </em></p>

  <p><em>Examples of physical assets that are the basis for calculating direct
  economic loss include homes, schools, hospitals, commercial and governmental
  buildings, transport, energy, telecommunications infrastructures and other
  infrastructure; business assets and industrial plants; production such as
  crops, livestock and production infrastructure. They may also encompass
  environmental assets and cultural heritage. Direct economic losses usually
  happen during the event or within the first few hours after the event and are
  often assessed soon after the event to estimate recovery cost and claim
  insurance payments. These are tangible and relatively easy to
  measure.</em></p>

  <p>Data provider at national level is appointed Sendai Framework Focal Points.
  In most countries disaster data are collected by line ministries and national
  disaster loss databases are established and managed by special purpose
  agencies including national disaster management agencies, civil protection
  agencies, and meteorological agencies. The Sendai Framework Focal Points in
  each country are responsible of data reporting through the Sendai Framework
  Monitoring System.</p>
RATIONALE: >-
  <p>The Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030 was adopted by
  UN Member States in March 2015 as a global policy of disaster risk reduction.
  Among the global targets, &#x201C;Target C: Reduce direct disaster economic
  loss in relation to global gross domestic product (GDP) by 2030&#x201D; will
  contribute to sustainable development and strengthen economic, social, health
  and environmental resilience. The economic, environmental and social
  perspectives would include poverty eradication, urban resilience, and climate
  change adaptation.</p>

  <p>The open-ended intergovernmental expert working group on indicators and
  terminology relating to disaster risk reduction (OIEWG) established by the
  General Assembly (resolution 69/284) has developed a set of indicators to
  measure global progress in the implementation of the Sendai Framework, which
  was endorsed by the UNGA (OIEWG <a
  href="http://www.preventionweb.net/publications/view/51748">report
  A/71/644</a>). The relevant global indicators for the Sendai Framework will be
  used to report for this indicator. </p>

  <p>Disaster loss data is greatly influenced by large-scale catastrophic
  events, which represent important outliers. UNISDR recommends countries report
  the data by event, so that complementary analysis can be undertaken to obtain
  trends and patterns in which such catastrophic events (that can represent
  outliers in terms of damage) can be included or excluded.</p>
REC_USE_LIM: >-
  <p>The Sendai Framework Monitoring System has been developed to measure the
  progress in the implementation of the Sendai Framework by UNGA endorsed
  indicators. Member States will be able to report through the System from March
  2018. The data for SDG indicators will be compiled and reported by UNISDR.</p>
